</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> stable-yard of Waring Park seemed
to be slightly off its head on a certain
fine afternoon in June. Such an afternoon
as it was, so sweet and so soft, so full of
fragrant sleepy haze, that any sound louder
than the sing-song of a cricket must have
distracted any ordinary nerve-possessing
mortal.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this particular afternoon however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the sole occupants of the yard were the
stable-boys, the groom’s urchin, and the
under-gardener’s lad, and as none of these
had yet reached the level of nerves, whilst
the blood of all of them throbbed with the
greed for illegal sport in every shape, their
state of lazy content was in no way upset by
a medley of blood-curdling shrieks, squeals,
and gobbles that issued from the throats of a
little boy and a big turkey which the boy
was swinging round and round by the
tail, from the vantage ground of a large
smooth round stone, with an amount of
strength that was preternatural, if one had
judged by the mere length of him and had
not taken into consideration the enormous
development of the imp’s legs and arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stable-boys grinned, and smoked
like furnaces as the show proceeded, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the other two cheered like Trojans, in
the cruelty of the natural boy, and it
might have gone badly for the turkey, if
there had not swooped down upon him
and his tormentor, just in the nick of
time, a little lean wiry woman, armed with
an authority, which even the imp, after
one spasmodic struggle, saw best not to
gainsay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Master Dacre, whatever do you do
it for? Do you think the bird has no
feelings? There is no sense in such
goings-on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is sense,” spluttered the boy
at full speed, “I like bein’ swung and I
like swingin’ the turkey, and I’ll learn him
to like it too, and if he don’t learn
that anyway he’ll learn something else,
which is life’s discerpline, which father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>says I’m learnin’ when you whip me. If
I want it, so does the turkey and wuss.
I b’longs to higher orders nor beasts and
birds.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here the grins of the stable-boys broke
into hoarse guffaws, and Mary’s ire culminated
in a sharp rebuke all round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Go to your work, you idle fellows. I
told your father long ago, Jim, what ’ud
be the latter end of you. As for you,
Robert, I could cry when I think of your
blessed mother!</p>

<p class='c000'>“And what business have you in the
yard,” she cried, turning on the two
younger sinners. “Be off with you this
instant. ’Tis easy to see none of the
men are about. You two, Jim and Robert,
you’d be surprised yourselves if
you could see what soft idiots you look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>with them stumps of pipes between your
jaws.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look, Master Dacre, look at the bird’s
tail. Haven’t you any heart at all? The
creature might have been through the
furze covert—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s not a feather broke,” said the
boy, after a critical survey, “not one; I
believe that tail were made for swingin’
as much as my arms was.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For an instant words failed Mary and
she employed herself hushing the bird
into his pen. When she came back, Dacre
had disappeared, and the yard seemed
to be quite clear of human life, not to
be traced even by the smell of shag
tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pursuit was useless, as Mary very well
knew, so she returned to her nursery a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>good deal down at heart, muttering and
murmuring as she went.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh Lord, whatever is to be the end
of it all? Learning is the ruin of the whole
place, and yet them children is as ignorant
as bears, excepting for their queer words
and ways. Set them to read a Royal
Reader or to tot up a sum, bless you,
they couldn’t for the life of them.
And the tempers of the two,” she went
on, putting the cross stitches on a darn,
“their parents had no hand in them
anyway. Where they got ’em from the
Lord only knows. Tempers, indeed! And
from them two blessed babies as bore
’em.” She lifted her head and glanced
out of the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look at ’em,” she whispered, “hand
in hand up and down the drive, talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>mathymatics, I’ll be bound,” and Mary’s
eyes returned to her basket a trifle
moist. She had nursed Mrs. Waring and
Mrs. Waring’s children, and she was a
good soul with a deal of sentiment
about her.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it happened, Mr. and Mrs. Waring
were not discussing mathematics. They
were just then deeply and solemnly
exercised in their minds as to the exact
date of a skeleton recently unearthed
from some red sandstone in the neighbourhood.
They had dismissed the carriage
at the hall gates, and were now
hot in argument concerning the bones,
each holding diametrically opposed views
on the subject, and struggling hard to
prove his or her side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now and again the husband’s voice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>rose to a pretty high pitch, and his fine
mouth was touched with a sneer, and
the wife’s eyes flashed and flamed and
shot out indignant wrath. Her hat had
fallen off far down the drive, and her
rings of yellow fluffy hair fell wildly
over her forehead, one small hand was
clenched in eager protest, but the
other was clasped tight in her husband’s.</p>

<p class='c000'>They always went like this, these
two; they had got into the foolish
way very early in their acquaintance
and had never been able to get out
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly some common hypothesis struck
them both at once, and Mrs. Waring cried
out with a gasp,</p>

<p class='c000'>“If we can prove it, I am right.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>“Yes, if you can prove it, darling, that’s
the point, and I hope that you never will.
Have you any idea, dear love, what the
proving of this will undo, what it must
upset?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think I have,” she said slowly, her
blue eyes gleaming eagerly, “but it seems
to me whenever a great hubbub is made
about the upsetting of some theory, that it
generally ends in being much ado about
nothing, and that the new thing that
springs from the ashes of the old dead, is
infinitely more beautiful than ever its
predecessor was, for it is one step nearer
the truth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dearest, we must end our talk,”
groaned Mr. Waring, peering with terrified
looks through his eyeglasses. “Here
is Gwen, most slightly clad and of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>bright blue tint, pursued by Mary. I
fear very much that story of Boadicea
you told her has instigated her to this
action. I think, dearest, I will go to
the study and work out this question of
date.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring turned nervously and made
a gentle effort to disengage his hand from
his wife’s, but she clutched him firmly.
“Henry,” she cried, “you would not
desert me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, my dear,” he gasped, “what can
I do? The child must be cleansed and, I
presume, punished. I can be of no use,”
and he still showed signs of flight, but
the horror-stricken eyes of his wife, fixed
pleadingly on him, made him waver and
wait.</p>

<p class='c000'>By a superhuman effort Mary got up first.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>“Oh, ma’am,” she shrieked in tones
that went through Mrs. Waring’s head,
“Oh, ma’am, look at her! I found her
with nothing on but this rag and some
leaves, painted blue, and varnished—varnished,
sir, eating acorns outside of
the orchard fence. It’s common indecency,
ma’am, and if it’s to continue I can’t”—</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time Gwen had arrived, desperately
blown, but overflowing with words;
rather an advantage under the circumstances,
for her parents had not one between
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mother, I were a woaded Briton and
blue all over. Mag Dow did me behind
and I done the front, and it aren’t common
naked if queens done it like you said.
She did, Mary, say it Thursday when
she begun the history course. Dacre was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>to be a woaded king too, but he were a
beast and wouldn’t do nothing but swing
turkeys for discerpline.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mary, I think perhaps you should
give Miss Gwen a bath, and then we
will consider what further course to
take.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring caught her skirts nervously
and drew a step nearer to her
husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A bath, ma’am! Don’t you see she’s
painted and varnished, no water’ll touch
that, ma’am, turpentine it must be and
cart grease, not to say paraffin,—and,
ma’am, the indecency!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Please, Mary,” implored the tortured
woman, “oh, please take her away and
put the cart grease on—and—the other
things, and we can then talk over the rest.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Here the light of a sudden inspiration
leapt into her face, and she turned to
her husband. “Henry,” she said solemnly,
“do you not think that Gwen should go
to bed? She seems to me,” she continued,
taking a critical survey of the blue-daubed
figure, “she seems to me a little
old for such very peculiar adaptations of
history.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To bed,” remarked the husband infinitely
relieved. It seemed quite a happy
solution to the whole question, and must
fulfil every purpose,—be Gwen’s Nemesis,
a salve to Mary’s hurt morality, and a
merciful deliverance to all others concerned.
“Yes, a very sensible suggestion of
yours, dearest. I consider that it would
be a most salutary measure to send Gwen
to bed.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Indeed, sir,” remarked Mary, without
a particle of the satisfaction that might
have been expected from her, “Miss Gwen
will be fit for no other place by the
time I’ve done with her, what with the
paraffin and the scrubbing and her skin
that tender. Oh come, Miss, come away,”
she cried grimly, laying hold of Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Grace, my darling,” said Mr. Waring,
passing his free hand wearily over his
brow, “such scenes as these are indeed
upsetting. I am quite unable to take up
the thread of our discourse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel as you do, Henry,” said his
wife sadly, “we seem to have so very
little time to ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think, Grace, we should procure
a tutor for those children? Let me see,
how old are they?”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“I have their ages down somewhere
in my tablets,” said Mrs. Waring rummaging
in her pocket, and producing a
little book of ivory tablets. She consulted
it anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just fancy!” she exclaimed with
astonished eyes, “Dacre will be seven
in April—I had no idea he was so old—and
I see Gwen is just twelve months
younger.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think their physical powers are now
fairly developed—indeed, I am of opinion
that the boy’s development will continue
to be mainly physical; he will, I fear, run
much to cricket and other brutal sports.
But no doubt he has some small amount of
brain power that should be made the most
of. We must now get someone who will
undertake this business for us, dear love.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“Ah,” said his wife plaintively, “the
feeding and physical care of children seems
a terrible responsibility; it weighs upon
my life. But the development of their
intellectual powers!—I wish the time for
it had kept off just a little longer, until
we were farther on in our last, our best
work. And if,” she said wearily, “you
think the brain power of Dacre, at least,
is so insignificant, the task becomes Herculean.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must consult the rector, dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel in some way we must have
failed in our duty. The grammar that
child spoke was appalling, as was also the
intonation of her words. I wonder how
this has come to pass? I should have
thought her mere heredity would have
saved us this.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>Mrs. Waring sighed heavily, fate seemed
against her, even heredity was playing
her false.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is shocking, dear, but accountable,”
said her husband soothingly, “you are
disturbed, and forget how widely modified
heredity becomes by conditions. If I recollect
aright Gwen mentioned one—Mag—h’m,
Dow. Children are imitative creatures.
And now, with regard to another
matter. I think, dear love, it were wiser
if you discontinued that proposed course
of history. The imagination of our daughter
Gwen must not be fostered until it has
a sounder intellectual basis to work up
from.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well, dear,” and Mrs. Waring
sighed a sigh of relief. No one but herself
knew the horrible embarrassment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>having those two children sitting opposite
to her and glaring all over her, while she
discoursed to them on the customs of the
early Britons, and it was only a consuming
sense of duty that had seized on her, and
forced her to the task.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Not</span> only the entire county of ——shire but
even the whole University of Cambridge
had been thrown into quite a whirl of
emotion by the marriage of Henry Waring
and Grace Selwyn, the most unexpected
ever concocted in heaven or on earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>A Senior Wrangler and a Fellow of his
college, who at twenty-six, eats, drinks,
and sleeps mathematics, besides being possessed
of other devouring passions for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>certain of the minor sciences, does not
seem a very fit subject for matrimony
with its petty follies and cares.</p>

<p class='c000'>If one is, besides, the son of a cynic
and a bookworm, who loathed and eschewed
the sex with bitter reason, and whose own
practical knowledge had been gained chiefly
through the classics and the bedmakers,
the one of which appeals but little to
one’s sense of propriety, the other still less
to one’s fleshly sense, the prospect of a
domestic and patriarchal career must seem
as remote as it is undesirable.</p>

<p class='c000'>And yet Henry Waring found himself,
to his constant and increasing bewilderment,
embarked on one almost before he altogether
knew where he was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year previous to his marriage he
had suffered a good deal from ennui. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>favourite theory in geology over which
he had peered himself half blind, was
suddenly exploded without hope of reconstruction.
He felt rather lost and <em>distrait</em>,
and cast about for some tangible solid
brainwork.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to pass the time until the fresh
inspiration came on, he took to propounding
stray problems, and—through the press—launching
them broadcast over the land.
Strange to say, he got answers, and by
the score. A good many more “mute
inglorious Solons” infest our villages than
we have any notion of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring groaned in spirit and mourned
over the depravity of the race as he read
their epistles, and drew farther back than
ever into his shell. If the average man and
woman without the academical walls resembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>these productions, the less one had to
do with them the better, he very reasonably
reflected.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this had been going on for the
space of three months, he came, one
morning, down to breakfast. He felt
very sick at heart; his pupils seemed so
amazingly full of enthusiasm for minor
concerns, and so absolutely lacking in it
for the one thing needful, that he was
cut to the quick and moved to much
gentle wrath. And then these letters!
They were fast becoming his Nemesis.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ate his breakfast and watched with
unwonted pleasure some dust motes dancing
in a sunbeam, and raising his eyes to
follow them, they unconsciously strayed
farther out into the college quad, where
the dew was still sparkling on every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>grass blade, and shimmering on every
flower.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring felt quite cheerful and
revived as he pushed away his plate and
cup and began to open his letters. Letter
after letter was laid down, a spasm of
pain passing each time across his face,
and more than once an audible groan
escaped him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last he picked up a letter gingerly,
as he handled all this variety of correspondence—the
village mathematician being
an unclean beast—but this letter seemed
somehow different, he turned it over with
growing interest, and even took the pains
to examine the postmark, then he opened
it and found a quite different production
from any he had yet received.</p>

<p class='c000'>First on opening it a curious indefinite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>scent struck on his nostrils. He sniffed
it up perplexedly; some queer old memories
began to stir in him, and he paused
a moment to try and classify them, but
he could not, so he set himself to examine
the contents of the missive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The answer given to his problem was
accurate and the accompanying remarks
clear, strong, and to the point, written
in a woman’s hand and signed with a
woman’s name, “Grace Selwyn”.</p>

<p class='c000'>That letter was answered before the
breakfast things were cleared away, and
certain fresh problems enclosed which were
not sent in any other direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many letters went and came after that,
containing problems and their answers,
the answers always full of that strange,
vague, delicious scent, which seemed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>waft itself through the study and to remain
there, caught with the dust motes in the
sunbeam.</p>

<p class='c000'>A longing and a yearning for those
little notes began to take possession of
Henry Waring and to disturb his mind.
Old memories of the time when he wore
frocks and toddled, began to haunt him,
and his work was no longer done by
reflex action.</p>

<p class='c000'>He consulted a doctor, but as he only
confided half his symptoms to that scientific
person, quite suppressing the letters,
the doctor felt rather out of it and prescribed
quinine, which had no effect whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c000'>One morning the yearning for a letter
grew suddenly quite overmastering; and
none came. This was the climax. By a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>sudden impulse which he never succeeded
in explaining to himself on any satisfactory
grounds, Mr. Waring went to his bedroom,
knelt down by his big chest of drawers,
and proceeded to pack a little valise with
every article he did not want, leaving
out all those he did. Then he stepped
into a cab and made for the station.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the close of the day he presented
himself at the door of a queer old red-brick
manor house in Kent owned by a
Colonel Selwyn and his wife, and asked
simply for “Miss Grace Selwyn”.</p>

<p class='c000'>In three months from that day the two
came down the path hand in hand and
stepped out together on life’s journey, and
six months later through the death of a
cousin, Waring Park fell to them and
made up for the loss of the Fellowship.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> very day after Gwen’s flight into
history Mr. and Mrs. Waring walked up
to the Rectory and got through their talk
with the master of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>They might not have been altogether
so prompt, being still absorbed body and
soul in the skeleton, but that, not only
was Gwen suffering tortures from the state
of her skin through the combined action
of paint, paraffin, and other ungents,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>but into the bargain she had caught a
bad and a quite abnormally noisy cold,
which kept her presence <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en evidence</span></i> by
fits and starts whenever she broke loose
from the nursery, and which was a
weapon judiciously wielded by Mary
to keep her parents well up to the
mark.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had delivered themselves to Mr.
Fellowes, and were now walking down
the Rectory drive, both looking a little
pained. Mr. Waring’s disengaged hand was
pressed to his forehead and his brows
were knit, and Mrs. Waring looked as if
she were engaged in a silent struggle
against disturbing thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air was still and soft, and some
stray stars had already taken possession
of the evening sky, where the little streaks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>of rose, left by the sun, looked quite out
of place, and felt it too, seemingly, for
they were creeping behind the hills with
a soft little shiver of dismay, like a timid
guest who suddenly discovers that every
soul but himself has left.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silence and the calm helped Mr.
and Mrs. Waring, who were both trying
to throw off the consideration of minor
matters and to return to that of vital
affairs. Generally so easy, like the slipping
back of a pair of seals into the
water after a rugged land journey, to-night
this seemed a strangely hard task
to tackle.</p>

<p class='c000'>They often seemed to receive the same
impression at the same moment, and something
or other in the bright glow of the
Rectory study and in the perfectly at-home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and at-ease air of a pair of twins that the
Rector’s wife had temporary charge of,
and had brought in to say good-night, had
given them a little jar which would keep
on quivering.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were not sufficiently tangible
sensations for discussion, there seemed
nothing in them that these two persons
could seize upon and argue from to any
purpose, so they were struggling to
put them behind them. Mr. Waring
succeeded, his wife was not so fortunate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vague feeling was quite like a Jack-in-the-box
for sudden appearances during
the next few days, and whenever it
sprang up, a little ache followed hot on
the heels of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last she made a supreme effort to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>regain her reason, and remarked with rather
deceptive cheerfulness,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think, dearest, we may now dismiss
this matter from our minds. I am quite
willing to trust it in Mr. Fellowes’ hands,
as I presume you are. You do feel perfect
confidence in him?” she questioned
a little anxiously, as Mr. Waring did not
speak for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Darling, yes!” he said with a start,
“in this matter certainly yes, this is
quite within his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>, I do not think
we could find a wiser helper or counsellor.
And he is so thoroughly a gentleman,
he so kindly waived his theological
objections when he found that on this
part of the question we had both arrived
at a fixed conclusion. Yes, in the choice
of a tutor we could desire no better adviser.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>At the moment you spoke I was
speculating upon Fellowes from another
point of view; I am really quite astonished
that a man so advanced in some
phases of thought should be so limited
so—almost retrograde—in others, and
above all, so strangely content with
his life, with hardly a moment in it for
undisturbed reflection, and no moment at
all for any attempt at valuable work. I
cannot imagine either where he finds companionship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused to sigh. “We have so
little time, love, to give to him, time is so
very much to us. Our other neighbours
seem to hunt when they do not fish and
fish when they do not hunt, they can have
neither time nor strength left for intellectual
culture. Then Mr. and Mrs. Fellows have,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>I believe, duties; they sit on Boards and
Councils and no doubt follow other pursuits
of like order, but as companions, naturally
they must be impossible. Then as to his
wife, she is a comely person—she is,
is she not, dearest? I am so very poor
a judge—but I do not perceive any glimmerings
of thought in her. You can better
judge of her, dear, have you ever discovered
any?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring considered for a moment
then she shook her head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do not think I have expected any,”
she said, “so indeed I have hardly looked.
I have only thought of her kindness,
and of her knowledge of children and
their feeding. I am very fond of her and
so very grateful, but I have never once
really talked to her.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“I thought so—it is strange—strange.
However, I am most thankful this business
is done, we may now be able to begin
those papers to-night—I look forward
with much pleasure to them. Curious
what very opposed views we take on
this subject—h’m, I fancy I am right,
dear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring thought not, and signified
the fact by a very decided shake of her
sweet golden locks, that looked more like
spun silver in the moon’s rays.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had now reached the great flight
of steps that flanked either side of the
entrance door.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they got to the top, by one
accord they paused, and leant over the
castellated ivy-clad wall that protected
the platform of granite slabs connecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>the two flights of steps, and gazed out
into the evening, but a sudden horrible
sound made Mrs. Waring jump nervously,
then quiver from head to foot, and caused
her husband’s brows to contract as sharply
as if there had been a spring in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It turned out to be Gwen scraping an
old violin and coughing frightfully all down
the corridor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dearest, do you think we should
summon Dr. Guy?” said Mr. Waring when
they had somewhat recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh no, love, Mary assures me there
is no danger whatever, she calls that
dreadful noise ‘a simple stomach cough’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In that case we must request Mary
to keep her in the nursery, such noises
are most upsetting. Pray be as quick as
you can, my darling, we might get to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>work at once. But surely it is not the
gong I hear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Love, I fear it is only too true,”
cried Mrs. Waring in trembling distress.
“I had no idea of the lateness of the hour,
and oh, Henry, we were late again yesterday
and the servants were quite upset.
Oh, you will be quick with your dressing,
will you not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then with one last little hand-squeeze
she fled to her room with a terrified
glance into the solemn face of a hurt-looking
footman.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> he had bidden farewell to the Warings
in his porch and watched them curiously
till a clump of firs hid them from him,
Mr. Fellowes went back to his study with
a very curious assortment of expressions
on his face; there was a good deal of
amusement there, a decided touch of sadness,
much doubt, and some dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had, however, little time to reduce
this confusion to order; an impatient tap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>at the door was followed by the entrance
of a bright eager little woman, in a
long trailing garment of a curious combination
of heliotrope and pale yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>“John, are you ready for me? May I
hear all of it?” she demanded, putting her
little hand on his big ones.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I feel in rather a yeasty condition
at this minute, but I’ll subside shortly, no
doubt. Will you be able to hold out a
little longer?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Haven’t I borne it for two mortal
hours and twenty minutes? Were they
talking all the time? I was in an awful
fright it was something I mustn’t hear.
Two scientists in trouble about their souls,
perhaps?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fortunately I can divulge all I know,
but you needn’t be flippant. It’s all very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>funny, but it’s just as woefully sad. What
on earth are you at?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pinning up my skirts, the fire would
ruin this colour in a night. Do you like
my gown?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do, but whether the parish will, is
another question.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, never mind the parish, I’ll teach
it; you have no idea how easy it is to
get round people if you know the track.
Is that yeast risen high enough or has
it gone sad? Remember I have held out
a frightful time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hold out another five minutes while
I write a note, I must catch this post.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mr. Fellowes brought his little
seventeen-years old wife home to the respectable
parish of Waring, just four years
before this time, it was the generally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>received opinion of most competent judges
that he had a good deal to answer
for.</p>

<p class='c000'>To begin with, she was American,
that fact in itself was quite without
precedent. The entire clerical annals
of the diocese did not furnish a like
example. This, to any right-minded
judgment, was as much as an insult to
the parishioners, who were in consequence
put to much trouble and inconvenience
in rubbing up their imaginations to tackle
the case, having no previous experience
to go upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deceased Colonel, of whom they
knew a great deal too much, and a living
peer, of whom on the contrary, they
knew a great deal too little, both
inhabitants of the county, had indeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>married Americans, the results in the
one case being disastrous; of the other
they possessed no proven data, but they
were at least at liberty to draw their
own conclusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for a parson to do this thing! It
was unheard-of, and partook of the nature
of a scandal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Mrs. Fellowes was pretty and
gay, and it must be confessed <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chic</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c000'>They could have put up with the
prettiness and even the brightness,—they
were used to certain varieties of both
these things in their own girls,—but the
<em>chicness</em>!—that was the quality their souls
struck against, it seemed expressly to
have been sent by Satan himself “to
buffet them withal”. And the girl’s dress
for a clergyman’s wife, was simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>audacious! And yet when a large and
representative female conclave had met
and dissected her “things” over half a
dozen teas, they were forced to the
conclusion that she had not a complex
or expensive article in her whole
wardrobe.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So much the worse,” Lady Mary, the
leader of the parish <em>ton</em>, remarked, and
with some reason too, “it shows that it
is not the clothes that stamp the girl, it
is the girl who stamps the clothes. There
is something fundamentally wrong there.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This being put in the form of an
axiom spread widely, and carried much
weight.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was four years ago, however,
and things had changed a good deal.
Mrs. Fellowes’ husband was no fool,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>he knew what he was about when he
brought home, as the finish to the one
long holiday of his life, the little New
England girl to be his helpmate.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Now</span>, Ruth,” said Mr. Fellowes when
he had finished and despatched his note,
and, lighting a cigarette, settled himself in
his armchair opposite to her, “I’ll yield
you up all I know. It was the queerest
interview I ever had with that queer
pair.—You needn’t wriggle with anticipation,
my dear, no human creature
could reproduce the scene with any justice
to himself or to his subject.—Waring had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>most palpably put on for the occasion a
brisk man-of-the-world air that was superb,
but his wife seemed dreamier than ever,
and limper, and her hat looked rather
askew.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It always does, but do go on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Directly you give me a chance, dear.
Waring opened the campaign with a little
small talk as he always does, but it was
quite off-hand and reckless to-day. He had
hardly set his gentle tap fairly flowing
however, when his wife suddenly woke
up and chipped in with quite phenomenal
clearness and precision,</p>

<p class='c000'>“‘Dear Henry, suppose we state the
object of our call, we can converse afterwards.’</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then it all came out. First one stated
a fact or a theory then the other had his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>innings. It was hard enough to follow the
two and to watch them at the same time;
one never likes to miss the moment when
they clasp hands again and the little looks
they cast on each other in the process. It
appears the pair meditate a definite experiment
on those wretched children, and
want my help in securing a bear-leader
for the task.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious!” gasped Mrs. Fellowes.
“Go on,” she commanded grimly, “what
is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“On no account whatever is either to
be sent to school or allowed to hold
intercourse with other children; no woman
is to have any hand in their tuition;
naturally, cricket, football, and every
other boyish sport is to be carefully
excluded from the curriculum, and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Christian teaching is to be utterly tabooed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy on us!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The facts of the Old Testament are
to be imparted to them with other ancient
history, and they are to be well instructed
in the natural sciences. By these means
they will learn to know God in His
Works—with a capital ‘W’—Mrs. Waring
observed this solemnly to her husband for
my benefit. ‘Exactly, my darling,’ he
replied, with a most surprising alacrity—they
had rehearsed this point, those two
babies.—When the children are launched
into their teens and have presumably
arrived at an age of more or less discretion,
the Bible and any other existing
evidences of Christianity obtainable, are to
be formally presented to them. The imps
may then receive these or reject them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>according to their particular turn of
mind, but in no case are they to be
biased.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The parents have seemingly occupied
themselves a good deal with this part of
the experiment and regard this presentation
of a choice of beliefs as a sort of
function on which they mean to take
exhaustive observation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The rector paused to roll another cigarette;
when he had finished and lighted it,
he went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ruth, you are an intelligent woman
and won’t misjudge me when I say, that
this experiment in itself seems to be a
reasonable one.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This Bible-reading question is an
awful one,” he went on, musing aloud,
“we all have had, every decent English
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>man, woman, and child of us has had
the Bible religiously drilled into him from
the time of consciousness till whatever
time he can manage to read it for himself,
then he is exhorted to carry on the
exercise independently, and a good percentage
of people do; you’d be astonished
at the number of people who never miss
reading their Bible every day of their lives,
and perhaps more astonished still if you
were to know the amazingly small effect it
has on the lives of these people. Even from
an intellectual point of view, it is incredible
to me how little the average human
being has grasped the heritage he possesses
in this book.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was speaking to a girl the other
day—by far the most intelligent one I
know in these regions—she was talking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to me with perfect unrestraint and frankness
about all sorts of things. She told
me she could see no beauty whatsoever
in the Bible, and that she had never been
able to derive an atom of encouragement
or assurance from anything in it.
If it did not bore, it upset her, and
made belief harder. It had become a
mere patter to her by vile reading and
intonation, and the remarkable turns of
thought given to it by many minds
insulted her reason. Even the poetry of
the diction had been spoilt for her and
seemed, she said, to reek of half-fledged
curates.—Under some conditions this experiment
of the Warings might prove a
success.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, but with that mother!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, yes, that alters the whole aspect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>of affairs! If you could only have heard
the passionless, analytical style in which
Waring and his wife discussed the matter
and speculated on the issue, which they
think will be more typical in Gwen than
in Dacre, his brute strength being, in
their opinion, his strong point, and his
theological side hardly worth considering.
They throw it in, however, ‘careless like’
as, if the experiment is to be tried,
it is just as easy to try it on two as
on one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy on us,” again said Mrs. Fellowes,
clattering the fire-irons viciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the way, Waring amused me
intensely by one revelation he made, he
could hardly get it out, and I saw him fling
a pathetically-deprecating glance at his
wife and give her hand a squeeze before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>he began. He felt he had to account for
the luckless Dacre’s strength of legs, of
which he seems to have as poor an opinion
as the Psalmist, he feared I might fall
into the error of casting the blame on
him or his wife, so he determined I should
know the real cause. ‘You will hardly
believe me,’ he observed, ‘when I tell you
that my wife with her refined intellectuality
is the outcome of long generations of
soldiers and of—ahem,—famous duellists,
and I fear our son, Dacre, is a very clearly-defined
specimen of throwing-back.’ Poor
Mrs. Waring! she felt her ancestry
keenly and got as red as a rose during
the confession.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Goodness gracious me! What a woman!
what a pair! What in the name of goodness
brought the two together and made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>them marry each other and produce
children. If I were Providence and
had that on my mind, I’d never look up
again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“My dear child!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“John, in the present state of my
feelings, brought on by you yourself recollect,
you must forget your sacerdotal
character and only remember my state of
original sin. Why should two beautiful
children’s lives be spoilt for the vagaries
of a pair who never had any right to bear
children? Think of Gwen’s sad old face
full of the trouble of all ages, think of
her naughtiness with that horrible unique
sort of infernal touch about it; that painting
herself blue is the most childish escapade
I remember.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was at Mrs. Doyle’s yesterday
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and she was telling me a lot about
Mrs. Waring before we came. After Dacre’s
birth, she said it was absolutely ghastly
to see her with the child, she was
terrified to hold it, and trembled like a
leaf whenever she absolutely had to.
Poor Mrs. Doyle, she got quite irritated
and excited about one thing; it seems
she could not nurse her own children
at all, and that Mrs. Waring was a
capital mother from that point of view,
and Mrs. Doyle seemingly could not
see at all why an unnatural little
bundle of scientific data should score
off her, a good wholesome creature made
for a mother, in this manner.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was certainly too bad, and one
would never have expected it of Mrs.
Waring,” said the rector laughing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Oh, and whenever Mary brought either
of the babies to her or she met them in
the corridors or about the grounds, Mrs.
Doyle says her one request was that
Mary should take the creature away
and give it food, it looked faint! They
were both huge, flourishing, healthy babies,
I hear.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ruth,” said Mr. Fellowes suddenly,
“I wish those people would keep away
from church.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are shedding your sacerdotal character
with a vengeance! What do you
mean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have no idea how they distract
me, sitting there together with their
eyes far away and their ears sealed,
except at the odd times they give those
spasmodic simultaneous starts, and twist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>their thoughts back for the minute to what’s
going on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, John, for the sake of the parish—”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If the parish can’t keep up to
its ordinary pretty low water-mark without
this prick to its piety it must be
in a poor state, and even more of a
discredit to me than I imagine. They
are far too good to be asked to play this
weekly farce for the parish’s sake. It
was Hopkins, not I, who insisted upon
this church-going and of course they gave
in in their gracious simple way; and
now, not even a water spout would
stop them from coming, they are so concerned
for my feelings. What a pair
of unconscious Christians they are to
be sure! One sees it cropping up in all
directions.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“I wish it would appear anyway in
the management of their children, I don’t
see many traces of it there. When is
this wretched experiment to be set going?”
asked Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As soon as I can procure a suitable
person to conduct it. I think I know a
fellow who might do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What business have they with children,
those two?” cried Mrs. Fellowes with
a little spasm of pain twisting about
her mouth. “I don’t believe those children
ever got properly hugged in all
their lives by that inhuman little mother
of theirs. And oh, Gwen’s dress! That
is awful!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, yes, that makes the whole affair
very much sadder! Don’t you think dinner
is ready? Yes, those children have a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>deal to fight against, it isn’t their ancestors
alone that will handicap them, poor little
beggars.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Cartloads of saints for ancestors wouldn’t
be worth a rap to them with an eerie
little creature like that for a mother,”
said Mrs. Fellowes hotly, in the pretty
lazy drawl into which her touch of twang
had developed itself. “I pity that wretched
coming tutor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She let her skirts drop and gave them
a dexterous kick as she went out, to give
them the correct “hang”.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>There</span> was no time lost in setting the
experiment going, and it was soon in full
swing. Its birth pangs were awful, and
embraced in their throes a great number
of persons. The parents’ sufferings were so
complex and so quite peculiar to themselves
that it is impossible to expound them to
an unsympathizing public.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tortures that couple endured during
the first few months after the initial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>stage of intellectual development had been
instituted and was being dealt with, were
severe, but they were in no wise connected
with their children’s anguish at the sudden
and unexpected onslaught on their higher
parts.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>Their</em> misery arose chiefly from the
jarring and inconveniently close contact
with tutors, whom, in their unconscious
Christian way, they found it their duty to
admit for some part of every day into
the edge of their lives. This was a terrible
discipline, more especially as during these
times the unhappy instructors also thought
it their duty to ease off their slough of
learning and to expand their social parts,
and thus the manufacture of small talk
became a daily necessity in the lives of
the distracted pair.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>They had both taken infinite pains to
provide silent entertainment for their guests—or
rather succession of guests—in the
tutoring line. The standard scientists were
first tried, and these seeming to have but little
effect, a whole cartload of mixed literature,
including all the rag-tag and bobtail of
fiction the bookseller wanted to get off
his hands, was imported and spread
about enticingly; theology and ethics
were also given a show, till at last all
the tables at one side of the room were
spotted with slate, yellow, and dull blues
and browns, and every form of journal
from the <cite>Times</cite> to the <cite>Police News</cite> was
scattered broadcast over the place, all
with a view to lay hold on the tutorial
mind and keep it independent of its
entertainers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Directly the tutor for the time being,
entered at his appointed hour, they rose
simultaneously from their work, as if the
same spring moved them, hurried towards
him with outstretched hands, sat down
side by side facing him, and broke
into conversation, which if gaspy, and at
times inconsequent, from the sudden upheaval
of waves of thought in one or other of
them, was kept up with gallant relentlessness
till the period of detention was at
an end.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the clock announced this
event, they broke off suddenly with a
click, and the tutor was, so to speak,
shot out, and the rent he had made
in the lives of his entertainers was
patched up as well as might be for
that day.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>But during the entire first course of
those tutors, Mr. and Mrs. Waring felt
always as if they were suffering from
ragged edges.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Gwen and Dacre, their first taste
of reclamation from the savage state, was
bitter, sudden, and condign. Civilization
seems the last thing in the world capable of
soothing the savage breast, especially if
the savage who owns it is young and in
rude health.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Mary suffered. It was a hard blow
to find her fledglings torn from her in one
fell stroke, and only allowed to return at
odd moments for repairs to skin and
clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Poor Mrs. Fellowes fretted herself into
a regular feverish attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the tutors themselves, the less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>said of their sufferings the better. Three
succumbed to them in four months.</p>

<p class='c000'>The one that followed, a most excellent
person and cut out for a family
man, broke off his engagement for fear
of consequences, his slight substratum of
scientific knowledge having got so much
stirred up while at Waring Park, that he
grew bewildered.</p>

<p class='c000'>If such results as he had to deal with,
he reflected, were to be seen in the
green tree what might not come to pass
in the dry? And he was well aware
of the cloudy ancestry of his lady-love,
and on his own side had not very much
to boast of. It was unfortunate. But
it certainly did seem sacrilegious impertinence
in him to attempt what his betters
had so egregiously failed in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Many</span> tutors had come and gone, and
much had been endured both from the
children’s point of view and from that
of the instructors.</p>

<p class='c000'>But time went on unheeding, and Gwen
and Dacre were lying under an old
cherry-tree in the orchard one day late
in August.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun shone aslant through the
crimson-tinted leaves above them, and threw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>flickering rosy shadows across the faces of
the two as they lay there in the cool
grass, with wisps of fern under their
heads for pillows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre, however, seemed to benefit but
little from this arrangement; his head was
oftener off its support than on; he twisted
and turned and wriggled and plunged,
even his toes moved visibly through his
thick boots.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was supposed to be reading, and
kept up the pretence from time to time,
but the words conveyed no sense to his
restless eyes, that moved as if they
were on wires. Now and again he got
irritated and threw the book down with
a snort.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sister and brother spent much of
their time together nowadays; fate had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>perhaps quite as much to do with this
close companionship as inclination, the
groom’s boy and his like, except at stolen
moments, being for Dacre things of the
past.</p>

<p class='c000'>This and various other reforms had
been brought about by Mr. Fellowes
and one tutor of an exceptionally strong
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>While Dacre wriggled, his sister lay
quite still on her back with her legs
stretched out, and with a considerable
reach of stocking visible between the
edge of her frock and her shoes. She
had one arm curled round her neck with
the sharp elbow stuck out uncompromisingly
in Dacre’s direction. It was useful
as a buffer and saved her many a lunge.
The other hand held a book, a queer old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>edition of Elia, which she was deeply
sunk in until she fell to watching Dacre
with a look of curious mockery on her
red curled lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d give my eyes to go to school!”
burst out the boy after an interval of
comparative silence. Mutterings never
counted in Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you have said six times this afternoon,
not to mention the mutters,” said the
girl, “what do you want to go to school for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You know without any telling.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to hear again.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“To jeer at a fellow, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I won’t jeer, and I might help you,”
she said with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her face dubiously, it was
inscrutable enough, but the mockery had
left her lips.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“I want to go, I hate to be here,
Greggs is a big enough fool but not quite
so much as the others, he ain’t all bad,
I’ll say that. But what’s he to other
boys and cricket and football and larks—oh,
you know!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder why on earth they let you
read <cite>Tom Brown</cite> when such heaps of
books are forbidden,” said Gwen reflectively.
“They have brought all this on
themselves,” she added, knitting her brows
in the exact manner of her mother. “We
have to bear what we earn, we hear
that often enough, I don’t see why they
shouldn’t apply it to themselves. Dacre,
you’re an awful ass, if I wanted all those
things I should have had them long ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All very well to say that,” grunted
the boy, “I’d like to know how.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I’ll tell you,—I’d worry till I got
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I worry pretty well as it is,” he said
with a self-satisfied grin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, in a stupid squally way—you
get into a rage and make a row and an
ass of yourself generally, then you get punished
and repent, or pretend to,—anyway
nothing is heard of you till the next bout.
You might be a dead cat for all the
importance you are—of course you’re
forgotten, and they go on working in
peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now if I wanted a thing and wanted
it badly I should take good care never
to be forgotten; I should let them see
there was to be no peace as long as I
was in the house; I should make myself
felt from the garrets to the kitchen; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>should gain my end,” she concluded with
calm finality.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the sun had forsaken their
tree and had flickered on to one nearer
the west, and in the evening light her
face gleamed out almost ghastly in its
pallor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, you’re queerer and queerer!
Why don’t you do all this for yourself?
You are quiet enough now, nothing only
sulky, why don’t you do what you say
I ought to, yourself?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For what?” was the sharp retort. “I
don’t want boys and cricket and football
and larks.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you want then?”</p>

<p class='c000'>She jumped up from her pillow and
looked out after the westering sun, her
eyes dark and dilated, her red lips parted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“What do I want?” she slowly repeated,
“I want—oh, you would not understand
what I want, but worrying won’t get
it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She caught up her book again and
threw herself face downwards on the
sward.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the way! You’ll never tell
me anything,” said Dacre angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll tell you one thing, and that’s I’ll
help you to go to school, and you’ll go
if you aren’t a common ass, and if you’ll
do all I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! I’ll do anything in the world
for you if you’ll only get me out of this
hole,” he blurted out in a spluttering fit
of gratitude. “Perhaps, even, I might help
you to get what you want, if you didn’t
make such a deadly secret of it,” he added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>looking at her as if he might somehow
extract it from her unawares.</p>

<p class='c000'>But her lips were tightly shut and her
eyes looked dead and cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One might as well expect to get
blood from a turnip,” muttered Dacre in
the choice vernacular of the groom’s
boy. “Oh Lord! that brutal bell, lessons
again! But you like ’em,” he said raising
himself slowly and turning on her
vindictively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There’s nothing else to like; pick up
your book and come. I hate to look
at Gregg’s eyes when we are late, I
think he had cats for his ancestors, and
not very long ago either, when he talks
quick he always spits. Oh, that vile
bell, we may as well run, he can’t see
us from the school-room window or I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>wouldn’t give him that much satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When will you begin the help,”
panted Dacre, as they pulled up at the
nearest point out of sight of the school-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll think to-night and tell you—Ugh!
Dacre, wipe your face you get so perspirationy
after the shortest run; I never
do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No thanks to you, when one can see
through you for thinness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The next evening when lessons were
put away, and the school-room tea over,
Gwen, instead of absorbing herself in a
book until bedtime, as she generally did,
took a restless fit. She moved about in
a noiseless sweeping way she had; she
threw the window open breathlessly, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>craned her head far into the breezy
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>A sudden gust that was carrying on
a wild dance with some maple leaves,
caught sight of her hair and seized
on it as a new plaything, or perhaps
mistook it for some of the orange-gold
leaves, and swept great lengths of it out
among them till her white face seemed
caught in a whirling net of brilliant
gold. When she drew back at last panting,
she shut the window and went over
to Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re pretty tidy,” she said, “for
you, but you might just take that black
smudge off your nose. Do I look right?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You look as mad as a hatter, but you
generally do that, only I think your hair
makes you look madder than ever.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>She caught her hair bodily, gave it a
violent shake, then took out her handkerchief
and rubbed her cheeks until they
glowed scarlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you at, making yourself like
a turkey-cock?” demanded Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We’ll both go into the library,” said
she in a sort of studied calm, “I heard
them go in after dinner and they think
I’m sick and don’t eat enough if I’m white.
Come on quick, now, while I’m red.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre came near and looked into her
face with some curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re madder to-night than I ever
saw you,” he observed. “You can go,
you will if you want to, of course,—I’ll
not, not if I knows it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you don’t I’ll do all I possibly can
to keep you at home.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>That and her look were decisive. He followed
her with an angry snort, and
they went swiftly down the low, broad
oak stairs with their winding curved
balustrade, down through the softly-carpeted
corridors. When they reached
the library door they stood with one
accord, stock-still.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re whiter than ever,” said he.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wipe your nose, you’ve rubbed the
black all over it instead of off it. Am I
red now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re magenta.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come on then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When the door opened slowly and
showed both their children standing in the
soft glow of the lamps, Mr. and Mrs.
Waring started up in some dismay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is anything wrong, my dears? Are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>you ill?” cried Mr. Waring, while his
wife came forward nervously and peered
anxiously from head to foot of the
two.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time even Gwen’s courage had
waned and the old feeling of having come
to judgment was fast gaining on her.
Dacre was already a flaccid lump.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You appear well, dears,” said Mrs.
Waring relieved, raising herself from her
inspection, “and Gwen’s colour seems to
me to be healthier than usual.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen felt smothered and speechless
but she made a vehement effort and
got out in an appealing hushed kind of
way,</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are quite well, mother, but we
came to see you, we thought you might
have time to talk to us and let us stay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>a little, we have been good at our lessons
so long.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The child lifted her eyes as she spoke,
and turned them hungrily from father to
mother in a way that sensibly embarrassed
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring took his finger from between
the pages of a book, came forward,
and looked searchingly into his child’s
face and then at his wife, who seemed
too astonished to take any active part
in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you not sit down?” he said
politely, pulling a couple of chairs towards
the pair, “pray sit down.—You have no
objection, dearest, have you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, oh no, I am very pleased
indeed, and it is also very pleasant to
hear you are advancing in your studies,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>said Mrs. Waring rather supinely.
There seemed so very little one could
say to one’s children. Mrs. Waring passed
her small hand across her brow, and
tried to look unpreoccupied, but it was
hard not to show feeling when a valuable
train of thought was broken, and
hours of good work rendered null and
void by this unfortunate intrusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband felt keenly for the gentle
little woman, and naturally a slight feeling
of irritation smote him as he turned his
gaze on his inconvenient offspring who
bore it in stolid silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre cast one rapid murderous look
on his sister then he sullenly accommodated
himself to his surroundings and sat on
like a log.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for Gwen, her tears were so near the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>surface that she had to swallow them with
a gulp, her eyes grew dull and lifeless,
the brilliant colour had all faded, and her
cheeks had a ghastly, streaky, livid look,
from the scrubbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you like something to eat, my
dears?” said Mrs. Waring eagerly. She
would not sit down but hovered above
her children, she could not fathom Gwen’s
horrid look of temper, and by this time
the streaky cheeks had quite a revolting
look. Her mother started at sight
of it, and whispered in quite an audible
voice,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Her skin seems unclean and mottled.
Dearest, I will speak to Mary, a Gregory’s
powder I should recommend.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s flush deepened the streaks to
lines of blood, and she could hardly keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>from shrieking out her wrath and indignation,
but she controlled herself and said
in a harsh level voice,</p>

<p class='c000'>“We would like nothing to eat, thank
you, we’ve had our tea, we came to see
you, you don’t want us. Dacre, I think
we might go.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then to the absolute staggering of the
boy, she turned, caught his hand, and
dragging him along by it went up and
stood before her parents, her eyes gleaming
strangely.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-night, mother, good-night, father—oh,
good-night!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good-night, my dears,” said Mr. Waring
blandly, and seeing that they still waited
he stooped down stiffly and kissed the foreheads
of both of them, then, with the air of
a man who has done his duty, he remarked,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“Dacre’s health seems to be more robust
than his sister’s, I think you are wise in
recommending something of an anti-febrile
nature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The children were half out of the room
by this time, and Mrs. Waring’s eyes
followed them with a puzzled stare. Something
had evidently been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, of course,” she cried, her face
lighting, and running forward she put a
soft detaining hand on a shoulder of each
of her children and laid a small kiss on
the middle of Gwen’s cheek. Then she
stooped to Dacre and did the same by
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wondered a little as she went up
to Mary’s room why Gwen shuddered
when she touched her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder if she’s feverish,” she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>thought.—“Oh, what agonies of responsibility
parents have to endure,” she
sighed, with yearning self-pity, as soon
as she reached the head of the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the children got to the nursery,
Dacre faced his sister with glaring eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Beast!” was his sole observation.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let me alone, oh, let me alone!” she
cried, “and, Dacre, open the windows, I
feel smothered.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You should live on the top of a windmill,”
he grumbled, but he did as she bade
him, and watched her with some puzzled
concern.</p>

<p class='c000'>She soon recovered from her smothering
and drew in her head and leant
against the window in silence for a
few minutes, then she said with calm
decision,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Oh yes, you can go to school, there
is neither reason nor justice in your staying
here. They might have prevented it to-night
if they’d liked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, you wouldn’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, of all the beasts! Girls’ secrets
are such fools of things, too! Don’t look
like that, it’s awful with your scratchy face.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, go to bed, do!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish you would, I think you are
going to be sick, I’ll call Mary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre, don’t dare to, I’m as well
as anything. I wish I was a witch and
could fly over those trees on a broomstick.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She peered eagerly out of the window,
out over the tree tops and the whirling
leaves, up into the dark heavens.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“You look witchy enough now with
your awful yellow hair that looks as if
it were alive with fire-flies.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre, go to bed, do, I want to think
of the plan.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, if you want that, I’ll clear, I’d
have gone before only I thought you were
going to be sick.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen turned a half-mocking half-wistful
look upon him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’re a good old thing and it isn’t
your fault if you are an ass, only I wish
you weren’t,” she said to herself when
he had gone, “it wouldn’t all be so beastly
then.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She went off slowly to her little blue-and-white
bedroom and let Mary put her
to bed in a cold silence which she positively
refused to break.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> ins and outs and general details of
Gwen’s plan of campaign would in no
wise interest, much less edify the moral
reader. It is enough that the plan was
a brilliant success, and its organization and
execution would have done credit to the
Prince of Darkness himself. Her tactics
were by no means volcanic, they were
resolute, gradual, and in a way scriptural,
line upon line, precept upon precept, first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the seed, then the blade, then the full
corn in the ear. When the initial steps
were passed, just leaving the air well
charged with vague apprehension and the
minds of men ripe for some new development,
active measures set in, in a careless
unconscious sort of way, as if the divine
order of things had just received a passing
jar, no more, but then this jar continued
and increased and grew in dimensions till
the very bones of the jarred shook in
their skins, and it was as much as their
souls could do to hold themselves in their
bodies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Three months after the plan’s inception,
the amazing goings-on of Dacre, the wild
originality of his pranks, the consistent
sustained <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">diablerie</span></i> of his outbursts, the
terrible all-pervadingness of his personality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>had succeeded in completely upheaving
the souls of his parents and filling the
entire household with a fearful sense of
insecurity, as of a community conscious
of the presence amongst them of an
invisible infernal machine, that moves by
some hidden power all over everywhere
and can neither be caught nor compassed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes, who kept a close
eye on the affairs of the Hall children,
had felt now for some time that there
was too much subtlety in this departure
of Dacre’s to be all his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The days of devil-possession are gone;
I could swear it’s Gwen,” said Mrs. Fellowes
one day, smiting her small hands together
and dropping a child’s petticoat on which
she was sewing a button.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“I’ve been thinking so for some
time,” said her husband, “all the same,
I hardly see where the ‘swear’ mends
matters.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, never mind! When a woman’s
perturbed, she often relapses into original
sin, it’s a full year since I ‘reckoned’—‘swear’
at least is cosmopolitan. I’ll go
up this minute and get to the truth of
this, Gwen hasn’t been near me for a
fortnight, and I’ve been so busy, you see,
I couldn’t go near them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall go too, I must get a subscription
for those miserable Gows from Waring,
but, little woman, hadn’t you better lie
down? After five nights up with Jim Brown,
even you must want rest!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Lie down! No, no; with this on my
mind, why, I couldn’t rest a minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>After a rather ineffectual attempt to
bring Mrs. Waring to a decent flesh-and-blood
consistency, Mrs. Fellowes retreated
to the school-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>“She grows worse and worse,” she
muttered, as she let out some of her
feelings in a sharp rap on the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gedge, the present instructor, was
not her husband’s choice, he was launched
on the children by a well-meaning uncle
of Mrs. Waring’s, who from time to time
swooped down on the family in a protective,
if rather hawk-like fashion, and invariably
set some reform afloat among man or beast.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this last visit he had let Gedge
loose in the school-room. The man
was as little fitted to deal with the
plan’s ramifications as a babe unborn.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Mrs. Fellowes went in she got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>a howl of welcome from Dacre, Gwen
gave her only a quiet handshake, but
the warm light that flashed into her cold
eyes told more than any howl. Mr. Gedge
stood up wearily and looked pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do sit down,” said he casting a furtive,
fearful glance on Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was in constant horrid dread of a
new sensation, they were so diverse, so
swift in succession, one never knew
when one might not come on, and it
might be embarrassing if set going in
the presence of a lady.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre, however, his familiar being otherwise
engaged, was quiescent, and Gedge
breathed freer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I have Gwen for the afternoon?”
asked Mrs. Fellowes.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was amazed to see the hesitation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>on Gwen’s face and the actual look of
dismay on Dacre’s, but she speedily
fathomed the reason.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew it,” she said to herself, “Gwen
is the mover in the whole business.”
Then aloud, “Gwen, you will come, dear,
Mr. Gedge’s eyes have said ‘yes’ already.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gedge had a lively though bashful
admiration for the little American, he
beamed his assent in quite a sprightly
way. “It will be one less to cope with,”
he reflected, “and I can perhaps get my
poor Amy’s letter finished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The devil, in a specially evil moment, had
revealed to Mr. Gedge’s pupils the existence
of this sweet young woman, and had thereby
added another hundredweight to the millstone
already encircling the neck of her
affianced.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Mrs. Fellowes looked with sudden
sympathy at the young man, then with
twinkling eyes at his charges, he seemed
so ludicrously out of proportion to his
task.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor thing!” She thought it with
such amused vehemence it almost got
spoken aloud. “Poor thing, you shall
have a peaceful afternoon for once!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Gedge, do give me Dacre too, do,
just for one day! He shall go for a ride
with Mr. Fellowes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh golly!” muttered Dacre, dancing in
his glee.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s face grew brilliant with joy,
she could now go with an easy conscience,
she couldn’t by any possibility have left
Dacre alone, he was too utterly “an ass”.
She could now have a whole long afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>to be happy in; she needn’t think once all
the time, only just laugh and play and let
herself be kissed—she never by any chance
ventured a kiss on her own account—and
she would feel Mrs. Fellowes’ soft hands
on her head—she always brushed her hair
for tea—and hear her soft voice, and it
would stay in her ears making little tunes;
and the Rector, he would be good too, and
remain in the drawing-room after tea—he
always did when they came—he was
always kind and he told such funny
stories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen’s contained joy broke out in a
prolonged “Oh!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes looked rapidly round the
handsome room and out into the Park, the
finest in the county, and back to the
child’s face.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“It is abominable, abominable,” she
thought angrily, “just to be away from
the place for a few hours transforms
the child, she is simply beautiful this
minute with that look—oh, it is brutal!
Gwen, love, run at once and put on
your things, and, Dacre, run down in the
porch, I’ll tell Mr. Fellowes you are going
with him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the children were gone she
said kindly,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Gedge, you’ll have a respite anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes,” he burst out, “I am
coming to see the Rector, I have endeavoured,
and I truly hope conscientiously,
to do my duty, but I find my present
position altogether untenable. I am not
a very strong man, Mrs. Fellowes, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>find this life is fast undermining my
constitution.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused for a moment; then he
went on hurriedly, in a sudden impulse
of confidence,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes, forgive my troubling
you with my affairs but you are so very
kind,—I have hopes, very dear hopes,
and from various strange sensations in
the region of my heart when my struggles
with Dacre have been specially trying
and prolonged, I have reason to
fear some fundamental lesion of the
organ.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Gedge had just been reading up
the heart in some medical journal, he
had also lately ascertained that his maternal
aunt had died of <i>Angina-pectoris</i>, so he
was naturally upset in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“If one has hopes, Mrs. Fellowes,”
he went on sadly, “one’s duty seems
to be to guard against anything that
must interfere with such hopes, always
supposing them to be lawful and
right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, I quite agree with you,” said
Mrs. Fellowes with much heartiness, and
with an unholy tendency to laughter, “I
agree with you, and no doubt, as is the
way of such things, your hopes are bound
up in the hopes and happiness of another.
For her sake alone you must consider your
position seriously.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I will turn my thoughts to some
other sphere of action, but before I leave
here,” he added with solemn resolve, “I
deem it my duty to my employers to
represent to them the urgent advisability
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>of sending my elder pupil to a public
school—I know you agree with me in
this, Mrs. Fellowes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Agree with you! why, we have been
fighting for it for years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then I may rely on your and your
husband’s help in this matter?” he asked,
looking rather askew admiration at her
through his eyeglasses.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had received a slight injury to
one eye in his youth, and according to
Dacre it was now “a game one”.</p>

<p class='c000'>By these suggestions of Mr. Gedge it
will be seen that Gwen’s leaven was
working.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> decree had gone forth, and Dacre
was to go to Eton. Ancestral taint and
sisterly guile had won the day, though not
without a tough struggle. The idea of
home culture, vague and ill-defined as it
was, died hard, and Mr. and Mrs. Waring
still bemoaned their fate daily in the
intervals of work.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were now much disturbed in
their minds concerning the plan of religion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>which they had conceived in the tender
youth of their offspring, and which had
been worked up to with rather more
consistency than usually characterized those
plans of theirs that dealt with outside and
minor matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>That it should have occurred to Henry
and Grace Waring was the most remarkable
part of this plan. They both looked
upon religion as they did upon art, as a
thing apart and on a somewhat low level,
to be considered in leisure hours. In some
phases of mind they might indeed almost
have been said to glory in it, and to
rejoice that the ages should own such a
heritage, just as one might rejoice in the
work of a great master.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were, of course, both too appreciative
of good literature to have neglected the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Bible, they knew every twist and turn in it
as they did of the Koran and the Brahminic
Vedas.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for doubts and things of that sort,
they never, so to speak, went in for
them, their minds were not of that order.
In the same way the truths or the untruths
of Christianity seemed to them an
interesting enough study between working
hours. In Mrs. Waring’s case, perhaps,
they appealed fitfully to some part of
herself she never quite understood, that
same sentimental part that often suffered
a keen stab,—for instance in the case
of the Rectory babies, and sometimes
from a strange look in Gwen’s face. But
she had almost ceased to speculate upon
these odd sensations, and was inclined to
put them down to a strain of puritan blood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>that had somehow trickled into the more
vigorous fluid of her fighting forbears, which
perhaps might almost account for her
preference for Christianity over other
creeds.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will be seen then that the reception
or rejection of Christianity by their
children, was a matter of no vital importance
to these parents. They were,
however, intensely interested in the result
itself, that was quite another thing; the
phases of mind the function must unfold
seemed certainly a subject worth research,
and filled them with the keenest
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are quite sure, dearest,” said Mr.
Waring, a few days before Dacre’s departure
was to take place, “that Mary has not
tampered with the minds of our children.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>“I am certain, quite certain. She has
certainly seemed to resent my orders in
this matter, but she has not disobeyed
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring sat down and tried to take
up the thread of her thoughts, but it was
broken again in a minute by Mr. Waring
pushing back his chair suddenly and looking
at her in a disturbed restless way.
She went over, laid her hand on his
shoulder, and looked anxiously into his
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are you troubled, love, can I not
help you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should be glad, my Grace, if I felt
more convinced that the minds of our
children are really a blank as far as any
knowledge of religion goes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am sure Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes——”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>“Dearest, the idea is revolting! Fellowes,
a gentleman! And his wife! She
is your friend, that is sufficient.” He
bowed as his grandfather, the courtliest
man in a courtly court might have done.
“But I fear that when very young the
children may have received foreign impressions,
the class that people the stable-yard
are often quite versed in what they
term ‘the truths of the Gospel’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But so long ago?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not so very long after all, and impressions
are most tenacious things, more especially
erroneous ones. Does the fact not hamper
us daily, dearest? Even this moment,”
he went on musingly, “after all these years,
I can recollect praying at my mother’s knee
with a quite astonishing fervour, which now
seems next to reasonless, and yet I doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>if the impression of that fervour will ever
leave me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can only hope, dearest,” she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband’s fear depressed her, she
was feeling just then, and rather to her
cost, how very remarkably clinging old
impressions were. They were hovering
round her at that very moment and
entwining her in a maze of the old dead
visions of dead days, when she was a
child herself and wore long lawn nightgowns
with frilled sashes, and said prayers.
She went over to the fire to make it up
and ended by putting it out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Henry,” she said at last, from
the hearthrug, shivering a little, “what
if, after all, we might just as well have
allowed our children to run along the
common groove like those very fat children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of Mrs. Manners’,—they seem wholesome
and not devoid of intelligence. And then
they are handsome and well grown, yet
the boy is ten and not even in Latin;
Mrs. Manners considers that in ten years
the fact will make no difference in his
career. On the contrary, look at Dacre,
think of the load of anxiety and thought
we have expended upon him and yet——”
She broke off sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her husband regarded her for a minute
with sympathizing eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dearest,” he said at last softly, “you
are apt to forget the fact that our poor
Dacre is—I hate to hurt you, dear, but
you know it—he is most unfortunately a
throwing-back, and must follow the fate
of his kind. He must enter the army,—it
is deplorable, but so it must be.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“The army!” murmured the small
woman wringing her hands softly, “it is
sad, it is hard on us. I do think, dearest,
we might have been more successful in
our children.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Our child,” interrupted her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her eyes clouded and she repeated
hesitatingly, “Yes, our child—Gwen’s abilities
are considerable.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” said her father with unmixed
satisfaction, “my hopes rest on Gwen,
her abilities are indeed most gratifying.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For one fleeting moment, which she
blotted from her memory with shame, her
mother almost wished they weren’t; she
might then be easier to get some knowledge
of, and not be quite so alarming.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> function was arranged for a certain
Wednesday in February, the day before
Dacre was to leave for school, and the
children had been given formal notice to
appear in the drawing-room at three o’clock.
They were now waiting in the school-room
speculating on the event. They knew it
must be something very unusual from the
fact of the drawing-room, of all places in the
world, being appointed as the scene of action.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>It was at the end of a dismal six weeks
of holidays, mostly spent, by reason of colds,
between the nursery and the school-room.
Indeed, it had been the very flattest
bout of holidays the two had ever yet
endured.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre’s object being attained, there was
no further use for organized “cussedness”
so he had relapsed into his ordinary state
of gusty wickedness, which being natural
was nothing very especial in the way of
a pastime, and quite unlike the six months’
excitement of his raid on society.
There was nothing to supply the place
of this now, nothing—neither cricket,
football, nor even riding—so small wonder
that life was pretty much of a blank to
the boy.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was even worse for Gwen, the mover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and the mainspring of the enterprise. When
she found herself landed victoriously on the
threshold of her goal, with her conscious
triumph there got mixed other sensations
of a most unpleasant nature. The horrible
feeling of flat inaction after the whirl of
action, that plays havoc with all great
conquerors, seized on her, and did the same
by this little one, and then she had none
of the fêtes and the follies that follow
hot on the heels of other conquerors
for their consolation. She felt the most
miserable victor breathing, her soul was
brimming with bitterness, and the overflow
vented itself largely on Dacre’s luckless
pate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children having nothing to go upon
could arrive at no very satisfactory solution
to their mysterious summons. Mary’s look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>as she smoothed Gwen’s hair, put Dacre’s
collar straight, and kept on fussing round
when she had no more to do, made
things look more mysterious still, then
she sighed like a steam-engine the
whole time, which added a presage-of-ill
character to the mystery that irritated
Gwen horribly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For goodness sake, Mary, do go!” she
cried at last in despair, “go! You are
like the old turkey when her ducklings
ran out into the lake the other day.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mary straightened her glasses and looked
at the child. “’Tis brains is the matter with
you, my dear,” she said; “however could
you guess at the very thoughts as were running
in my head? I was thinking of the creature
flapping there helpless and I was lik’ning
myself to her that very minute. Master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Dacre would never have guessed it, bless
him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen felt she had scored a point and
continued,</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is going to happen to us, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mary regarded her in silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you know you might tell us,” said
the girl impatiently, “or,” she added scornfully,
“are you still more like the turkey,
and are only frightened because you know
so little?—you look like that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh Lord!” muttered the woman under
her breath, feeling very hard hit, but she
replied with dignity, “My dear, it certainly
ain’t my place to tell you what your
parents have thought fit not to acquaint
you with.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They see fit to acquaint us with
nothing as far as I can see. Well, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>you can’t tell us or don’t know anything
to tell us, do go away, please. You move
about so and look so queer, you make one
think that a horrible new thing is coming on
us, so do go, please. I’m not cross or nasty,
only I feel queer myself and frightened, I
could scream and yell and howl this
minute—oh, I wish Mrs. Fellowes was
here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is coming, my dear,” said Mary,
looking anxiously at the girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, she often looks like that,” said
Dacre consolingly, “I believe she is mad—she
is dying to squeal and screech
and yet she is as quiet as an old rat, I
believe myself one good roar would do her
good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mary was a sensible body and knew
when a thing was beyond her powers, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>said nothing but went down and intercepted
Mrs. Fellowes on her way to the drawing-room
and carried her off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is Gwen well, Mary?” she asked, as
they went upstairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Eats and sleeps well, ma’am, but she
has an over-active brain, ma’am, I should
say, and if ’tis, ’tis only God can help
her,” whispered Mary solemnly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen had recovered by this time and
she and Dacre were engaged in a wrangle,
stormy on Dacre’s side, sarcastic and calm
on Gwen’s. At sight of Mrs. Fellowes
they left off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh you dear, you dear!” cried Gwen
sweeping up to her, and taking her kiss
with a sort of gasp, “we feel awful, as
if some new horror was coming on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ll stand by us, Mrs. Fellowes? Do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>you think they might repent of Eton?
Gwen gets mad when I say that, but, you
know, no fellow knows what they’ll do
next,” he added plaintively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre, I wonder if you know how
horribly impertinent you are? If you
belonged to me and spoke of me like
that, I’d cut you for a week!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, but you’re quite different, of course
no one would speak of you like that—Oh,
come in!”</p>

<p class='c000'>A new footman, a tall awkward creature,
who found his brains softening in this
astonishing family, had been giving a
succession of small knocks for the last five
minutes, at last he supplemented them by
a choking cough.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is that giraffe,” said Gwen
impatiently, “I suppose we are wanted!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Mrs. Fellowes, look at him,” she whispered,
“everybody who comes to this house looks
like that in a week, and as for Mary, she
is awful, going about in a muttering way
and glaring at me as if I was a penny
show. The tutors are the same, even
that great leggy gawk—oh dear, what’s
the matter with us all?</p>

<p class='c000'>“And another thing—oh, wait just a
moment, they’ll never know if we’re
one minute late or twenty, they don’t
want us a bit, oh no, they never
do, I tell you, they are quite happy
and oh, so busy, so appallingly busy—I
want to tell you another horrible habit
the people here have. I must tell you all
this,” she added seeing Dacre’s rather
astonished face, “it has all just come up
to the surface of me. The people in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>place always whisper in the most diabolical
way, there is never a single sound in
these corridors, never, and that’s why I
often nearly—burst to howl and screech.
Dacre is an idiot as everyone knows, and
he says I’m mad.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush, child!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh well, come on then, but there’s
not an atom of hurry, they don’t want us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes isn’t such an ass as not
to know that,” said Dacre scornfully, “but
I want to know what’s on in there, so
does she, so come on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s nothing nice, you may be quite
sure, it’s probably got something to do
with lessons. Perhaps they want to examine
you before you go to school,” she
added with a fiendish laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her mouth was terrible in its hardness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>Mrs. Fellowes stooped down quickly and
kissed her on it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, love, you don’t know, something
very nice may be going to happen to you,
the very nicest thing that has ever yet
happened.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked up at her astonished, some
tone in her soft voice touched her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder—” she said slowly, “I
wish——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What dear?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I don’t think I know,” said she, with
a short laugh. “Come on! Gru! Look
at the table covered with books and things!
I knew it was an exam! Look, Dacre!”</p>

<p class='c000'>When her greetings to her host and
hostess were over, Mrs. Fellowes went over
to her husband, who was standing by
the table of books.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“One of the evidences of Christianity
to be placed before the infant mind,” he
said softly, pointing to <cite>Lord Amberley</cite>.
“Another!” and he put his finger on
Renan’s <cite>Life of Jesus</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious! you’ll stop that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I can—what’s wrong with Gwen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t know, I put my foot in it just
now by pressing for an explanation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre, meanwhile, was feeling less than
a worm under the concentrated gaze of
his parents. After the first remarks concerning
health addressed to both children,
with a casual allusion to his projected
departure for school for Dacre’s benefit,
and an earnest request from his mother
to consider his teeth and his stomach and
to eschew sweet-stuff, “the great temptation
of public schools,” she observed sadly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>and when some supine observations with
regard to things in general had been
turned on Gwen, Mr. and Mrs. Waring
looked appealingly at each other and subsided
into a silent and curious inspection
of their son.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dumb endurance of the boy showed
a good deal of pluck; he merely wriggled
spasmodically from time to time. But he
had come to the extremest end of his
tether and was on the point of some
outbreak, when deliverance reached him
in a low swift sigh from his mother, and
a queer sudden movement on his father’s
part, who pushed back his chair, loosed
his wife’s hand with a deprecating “Pray,
my love!” and began to speak in a
general inoffensive way, fixing his gaze on no
one in particular, to Dacre’s infinite relief.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>“There are subjects that are usually
comprised in the education of young children,”
said he, “which we, after deep and
anxious thought, have seen fit to omit from
the curriculum of our son and daughter.
We have taken special pains to impress
upon their various instructors, as also upon
the persons appointed to their personal
service, that a certain part of their minds
should be kept free, entirely clear and
free from certain impressions, that they
should remain, so to speak, a blank as far
as regards this form of knowledge. The
form of knowledge I allude to—” he
continued, his eye falling once more on
the luckless Dacre who was drinking in
his words with open-eyed wonder, and,
finding the boy useful as a target, he
fixed him inexorably until the end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>discourse. “The form of knowledge I
allude to is that known as the knowledge
of religion. It is sometimes called a sense,
and has in a manner become so by heredity,
but I doubt much whether it was innate
in the race in the beginning. This point
of view has of course powerful advocates,
as we all know, at least—” he added
coughing nervously, “as Mr. Fellowes and
his wife know. However, this question
though most interesting is not necessary
to my explanation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Here his eye which had swerved for
a moment, again caught Dacre’s. “The
reasons why we have insisted upon the
denial of this knowledge to our children are
many. Firstly, my wife and I consider
that it is hardly fair to any human
creature, with normal brain power in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>its young receptive condition, to give this
brain power a distinct bias with regard
to the fundamental points of any science.
I speak of it not in the common but in
the original application of the word, which
is merely empiric and can certainly not
be looked upon as proven in any part,—however
great its ethical value as a
factor of culture may be,” he added with
an apologetic glance at the rector. “For
the same reason we have withheld geology
and the advanced parts of several of
the natural sciences, wherein is evolved
the doctrine of evolution. But of these
later.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have been more stringent in our regulations
with regard to religion and its most
advanced and refined development—that
known as Christianity—because it enters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>so largely into all current questions, and
entrenches, or at least the arguments of
its exponents do, on so many of our more
exact sciences. Another reason for withholding
this knowledge was the strange
methods so many of its disciples have of
apprehending and applying it—even of
considering its literature. The process of
exclusion by which we have striven to
our goal has, I fear, seemed to our dear
friends here to-day an unwise one, but
we have taken deep thought concerning
this matter and have taken no step lightly.
We have awaited a state of consciousness
in our children capable of receiving and
judging the evidences of religion—more
especially of that form of it known as
Christianity—in an unprejudiced and reasonable
manner, without bias, and with no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>early half-true half-false impressions to
confuse and mislead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Fellowes,” he concluded with
solemnity, “we have done, as we consider,
our duty, and in the best way we know
of. Heredity and other inner influences
will no doubt in some measure nullify our
efforts, as will also the possible impressions—no
doubt of a low order—which our children,
in that period of mere physical development
before the culture of their higher parts
began, may have received from outside;
but with these exceptions, I feel confident
that, as regards all knowledge of religion,
the minds of our children are a blank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He was silent for a moment and regarded
the blanks with supreme satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Fellowes,” he began again, “my
wife and I are most anxious that our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>children should receive all the facts and
arguments in favour of Christianity before
the counter arguments are put before
them, and in the most reasonable and
enlightened manner. We have therefore
invited you to be present to-day and would
feel ourselves under still one more obligation
to you—” here he looked from Mr. Fellowes
to his wife and so made one of
them, “you who are so eminently fitted for
the task—if you would make our children
acquainted with the leading points in the
history of religion. Would you also be so
good as to direct them in their course of
reading—our daughter at least, for Dacre, I
believe, goes to Eton to-morrow? My wife
and I have, as you know, been reluctantly
obliged to relinquish our plans in this
instance, owing to the pressure of strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>ancestral bias which will, I fear, also compel
us to allow the boy to devote himself to
brutal pursuits, and finally to enter the
army. His ordinary culture then in religious
matters must be entrusted to the tutors
of his school, who, no doubt, will fill his
mind with strange vagaries. However,”
he went on with a fixed melancholy look
at the boy, “Dacre’s intellect is not of
a high order, it matters little; but with
Gwen very specially we desire your aid.
We have discovered in her an unusual
power of applying knowledge, and we would
be glad if you would examine her from
time to time, that she may have a sound
and reasonable knowledge of the arguments
on the one side of this very interesting
question, before she considers those on the
other; we may be accused,” he continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>with a sigh, “and perhaps justly, of an
unfair attempt to bias the girl’s mind by
not arranging that the study of the opposed
facts and arguments should run side
by side with these. But in this matter, I
fancy,” he said, with a little smile at his
wife, “I fancy both my wife’s and my
hereditary tendencies have rather handicapped
our intelligence, I do trust with
no ill-results to our children,” he added,
embracing them both in one perturbed
glance and sitting down rather wearily.</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>During</span> the latter part of this discourse
Mr. Fellowes had been sorting the books
on the small table, and had them now
arranged in two separate heaps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen had been gradually edging her
chair near Mrs. Fellowes and her face
was alight and eager.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any new thing is always full of possibilities
to a young creature moving out
in all directions after experience. Besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>there was an undercurrent of quiet
anxious affection running all through her
father’s half-incomprehensible speech, that
struck her and kept down for the moment
her usual defiant attitude of mind when
had up before her parents.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dacre’s reflections, whenever the paternal
eye was off him, partook of the most
primitive simplicity.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank goodness, I’m out of it. After
all, it’s a good thing to be an ass; and
the army, oh golly! I never expected
anything so sensible as that from ’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With that he winked lugubriously in
Gwen’s direction and was rather upset by
catching Mr. Fellowes’ eye instead.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am quite certain that whatever you
and Mrs. Waring have done in this matter
has been done most conscientiously,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Mr. Fellowes discreetly. “I am glad you
think me capable of teaching your children,
what to my way of thinking is the head
and front of all knowledge—the knowledge
of God and of His Son, Jesus Christ—”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked at Mr. Fellowes with an
astonished eager gaze.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This all sounds quite good,” she
reflected, “but then, is it? Things are
so very different from sounds,—every tutor
before he comes, sounds lovely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, Mr. Waring,” continued the rector
mildly, “if you entrust this matter to me
you must also entrust me with the choosing
of the books bearing on the subject; for
instance, I should decidedly reserve this
book, <cite>Lord Amberley</cite>, also this, Renan’s
<cite>Life of Jesus</cite>, for that future period when
you intend to give your children the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>evidences against Christianity. These, to
my mode of thinking, would certainly be
valueless for our purpose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, Mr. Fellowes, you surprise
me!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He went over and glanced in rather
a hurt way at the books, “I consider
that work of Lord Amberley’s a most
unimpassioned, useful, and an eminently
trustworthy history of religions. Lord
Amberley seems quite of our way of
thinking—my wife’s and mine—for though
he theorizes so little, confining himself
chiefly to the recording of facts, yet in
the whole tone of the work, one notices
his <a id='pre'></a>predilection for that religion instituted
by Christ over other faiths. I must say
I should have considered <em>that</em> book a valuable
one in your cult; however, you are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>specialist,” he remarked magnanimously,
“we but dabblers in these matters, therefore
we are bound to yield our judgment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for Renan’s <cite>Life</cite>, it appears to me
to be a charming composition, simple, and
in style delightful. I should have thought
it would have appealed pleasantly to the
childish comprehension; however, as you
object, with, no doubt, full and sufficient
ground for your objections, we will leave
the matter entirely in your hands and in
those of your dear wife,” he added with
a stiff bow in her direction, “a most
excellent helpmeet in this as in all other
things.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Mr. Waring, please don’t imagine
that I meddle in all my husband’s business!”
cried Mrs. Fellowes, half-amused and half-angry;
it was too abominable to be made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>a sort of co, or under-curate to her husband,
even by this pair of curiosities. “I should
never dream of interfering in the religious
instruction of anyone, either young or old;
and if I had any mind to, I assure you
my husband would soon strangle that
tendency in me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh dear me!” murmured Mr. Waring,
“we always act so much together that I
never thought of interference in such a
connection; pray excuse me, dear Mrs. Fellowes,”
he entreated nervously.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes could have slain him and
herself. She kept her eyes carefully turned
from her husband but she felt his silent
malicious laughter to the very tips of her
fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Waring, there is nothing whatever
to excuse, it is only a little silly clerical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>point of etiquette. You have no idea how
the clerical mind runs to trifles, I am
only beginning to get any correct notions
and I have been studying it now over
eight years. It is much more interesting
than geology,” she continued, turning to
Mrs. Waring and awakening her out of
her reverie, “and requires quite as much
hammering to get anything worth having
out of it. John quite agrees with me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, Mrs. Fellowes, it is so easy for
you to see fun in things,” said Mrs. Waring
in a pretty wistful way; “it is quite a
gift, I fear it has not been bestowed
upon me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good gracious, I should think it hadn’t!”
said Mrs. Fellowes to herself, “if you had
a spark of it you’d keep him in his right
mind as well as yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>“Don’t you think Dacre looks rather
idiotic?” whispered Gwen suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He certainly did, with his mouth ajar
and the bright red tip of his tongue visible
through his teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They always have that effect upon him,”
continued Gwen, “a frequent course of it
would very soon land him in an idiot
asylum.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hush, dear!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring seemed now ill at ease and
not at all satisfied at the way things were
shaping. The affair was missing fire both
for him and for his wife; they wanted, so to
speak, a thorough microscopic examination
of their children; they wanted them then
and there put out on the table and carefully
gone over as a preliminary proceeding,
even if as yet no final and systematic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>classification of their contents could be
attempted.</p>

<p class='c000'>Where was the result of research to
come in if the one was to be shipped off
to school the very next day, and the
other to be turned over to Mr. Fellowes?
Mrs. Waring’s mind also ran in this groove.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will there not be an examination now
at once?” she asked in pained surprise.
“I quite understood this was our arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I too, dear love; we must discuss the
matter. Mr. Fellowes,—ahem, my wife
and I thought it might be as well to
examine the state of our children’s minds
now at once; it seems important to ascertain
clearly how far our plans have been
successful, and in this we might be of some
help to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>Mr. Fellowes looked gravely annoyed.
Dacre started violently and nearly took
the tip off his tongue, and Gwen’s face
fell; she straightened herself and a transfiguration
fell upon her, her mouth hardened,
her colour faded to a dull gray, and her
eyes took on the masked look that Mrs.
Fellowes so detested to see.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Always the same!” she muttered,
“always the same! I was beginning to
think that with Dacre going to school and
everything we might be let off and have
tea instead. Look, there it is getting
stone cold, they’ve clean forgotten it! I
never can answer a word when they question
me, it’s beastly unfair to force one
into looking like a fool when one isn’t.
Dacre, of course, might be a cabbage this
minute—look at him! They treat one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>brains like puppets to dance when they
whistle!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, dear Gwen, you let your tongue
go mad!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen winced, she prided herself a good
deal on her strength and reticence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“As for the examination, it is quite
natural your father and mother should
arrive at some idea of your state of mind,
and as they start on the premise that you
know nothing they won’t expect you to
shine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You don’t know,” said the girl surlily,
“one can’t argue from experience with
regard to them ever, they are as reasonless
and as unjust in their expectations as they
are in everything.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, I am ashamed of you, you are
unjust and no one else, and rather rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>seeing that any questions you have to
answer will be asked by Mr. Fellowes.
Now listen, either your father or my husband
is going to speak.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your father and mother,” said Mr.
Fellowes coming over and standing so that
he could watch both of the children, “have
asked me to put a few simple questions
to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The countenances of Mr. and Mrs. Waring
fell visibly, this informal, good-humoured,
casual way of carrying on, was not the
sort of thing they had expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>“One should make a speciality of every
form of knowledge, however trivial,” said
Mr. Waring in a low voice, “we should
have put ourselves in a position to be
competent personally to conduct this
affair.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>His wife looked comprehension, and
clasped his hand a trifle harder.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one but themselves and possibly
their Creator had any idea of the amount
this unfortunate couple had to endure.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I ask you anything,” went on the
rector, “and you can’t answer it, you
mustn’t mind, for as you just now heard
from your father you are not expected to
know anything definitely.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked up with a quick sarcastic
question in her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fellowes laughed. “You think in
that case I had better hold my tongue;
well, perhaps I had, but even if one gains
no absolute knowledge of the question
asked, from the answers to it, one sometimes
finds out other things just as useful.
In your classical readings you came across
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>many allusions to the gods of Greece and
Rome, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” they assented. “That wasn’t
much of a poser,” reflected Dacre glibly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“On the whole what did you think of
them?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were pretty mean,” said Dacre
with conviction.</p>

<p class='c000'>“They were just like other people, only
stronger, and better looking, and bigger,”
said Gwen.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you be inclined to think any
one of them capable of any great or stupendous
work?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Goodness no!” said Gwen, “they had
a great deal too much to do with their
little things; punishing mortals too, that
took up half their time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, then, who do you imagine made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>the world—have you ever thought on the
subject?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is most distressing,” whispered
Mr. Waring, “he seems about to give
all these rank hypotheses as facts—this
is childish, unworthy of Gwen’s
intellect!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dear love, you are unfair, there is
absolutely nothing proven on either side.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the counter arguments will not
be presented as facts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The religious school has firm convictions
and admits no hypotheses, I have heard.
I confess this primitive mode rather interests
me; I wonder what Gwen’s reply
will be—hush, here it comes!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I never could think of any one person
undertaking such a work,” said she, looking
rather interested. “I have always thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>it was done by some ceaseless force, that
keeps things wound up.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think this force a beneficent
one or the contrary?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Just as the humour takes it. It seems
sometimes quite human in its tempers and
its injustice; rather capricious and old-womanish
too,—I often think that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why! From the stupid times and
places that earthquakes and waterspouts
and things come, they hardly ever burst
up or beat down desert islands or places
like that; they always flock to populated
places where people have been working
for years to make themselves comfortable,
and then all in a minute their work is
undone and they may think themselves
lucky if they aren’t undone altogether.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>That sort of thing seems reasonless and
like an old woman.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor little foolish Gwen!” said Mrs.
Fellowes, with such a funny look that Gwen
had to laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“When you are older,” said Mr. Fellowes,
“and know more, you won’t be so final
in your judgments. I’m going to tell you
a fact now, will you believe it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen got scarlet, the question seemed
to her a reproach. “Mr. Fellowes, of course
I will!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then, Gwen, incredible as it sounds,
a great, a glorious, and an Almighty God,
a Spirit, Who has had neither beginning
nor end, made this world and keeps it
going, and He is neither unjust nor unreasonable,
capricious nor an old woman,
though,” he continued to the open-eyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>wonder of two in that room, “that you
should accredit Him with all of these rather
despicable qualities, does not astonish me
in the least. Can you take my word for
this fact I have told you? If you can’t,
say so; I need not ask you, however, you
will be honest,” he added with a little
amused laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It sounds rather queer and mixed up,
considering things as things are,” said
Gwen quaintly, “but I’d take your word
for anything, Mr. Fellowes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Just then some unlucky impulse guided
her eyes in her mother’s direction, a little
softening towards her had seized on the
girl for the instant and her eyes had
followed her thoughts, but they dropped
like a shot, she stiffened, and loosed hold
of the piece of Mrs. Fellowes’ dress she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>had furtively been clinging to. Her
mother’s eyes were fixed on her in
a puzzled, uncomprehending, rather disappointed
way, horribly trying to her
pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll not say another word, not if they
tear me with wild horses!” she said to
herself tragically. “How dare she look at
me like that! Now, Dacre, upon my
word, I would not blame her if she did
it to him! Dacre, you look awful!”
she whispered viciously, “more beastly
than human! Shut your mouth!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And not another word could Mr. Fellowes,
to his infinite relief, extract from
the girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the boy he was, on the face
of it, hopeless; so in defiance of and despite
the protesting attitude of the harassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>parents, the rector calmly put his foot down
and brought this ceremony to a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mr. Waring,” he said, “I think you
must be satisfied that at least we have
fairly virgin soil to work in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Waring mumbled a gentle, “H’m!”
He was thoroughly dissatisfied with the
whole business.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will you allow Gwen to come to
our house,” went on Mr. Fellowes imperturbably,
“every Tuesday and, let me
see, every Friday afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen flashed a glance of delight on
Mrs. Fellowes and across her she flung
a grin of defiance on Dacre.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And to Dacre, if you will allow me,
I will give one or two books to read
when he happens to get time. Story
books, Dacre, don’t squirm.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Mr. and Mrs. Waring again looked with
melancholy regret at each other, then
extended the glance to their offspring.
When it reached Mr. Fellowes a slight
touch of gentle wrath had flittered into
it, but it was in vain to kick against
the pricks, the proceedings were at an
end, and another failure had died and was
buried out of their sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>And then they all drank some cold
tea, and little atoms of cake were presented
to the children, with a timid request
from their mother to pick the currants
out of them, this bugbear of their infancy
still clinging to the little woman, and the
drawing-room twilight was left at last
free to the pair who looked haggard, tired,
and frustrated.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Dacre</span> had been shot through Eton into
Sandhurst, and Gwen was fast growing up
and imbibing religious instruction in precisely
the fashion one might have expected
from her surroundings and her turn of
mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>She received the facts as facts, and
<a id='got'></a>got very keen and eager over those
that had any dramatic interest in them.
She dug into their depths and revelled in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>them as any other boy or girl of sound
intellectual capacity would do, when they
were put as Mr. Fellowes put them. The
unsatisfactory part of the business was
when the horrible critical faculty of the
girl began to ransack the facts and the
theories hung on them, and to turn them
inside out, and to compare and classify
them with an honest downright unscrupulousness
that no girl suckled on the
Bible could ever, no matter what her opinions
might be, or rather her own opinion
of her opinions, find it in her heart to
use, and the summing up of Gwen’s searchings
and comparings was monotonous and
commonplace enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The whole scheme is very fine,” she
said one day, “it is a perfect idyll in its
way, and divine from the mere exaltation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>and grandeur of it, but where any proof
of a personal God comes in I can’t see,
any more than in any of the other creeds.
They all seem to be chips off the same
block. The ideal God seems universally
human—this Jewish one with the rest.
He is feeble and tyrannical and He, in the
Old Testament, is so inconsistent; and in
the New—well, after all, that is only rather
a more modern reflection of the Old. As
for Christ, we know so little of Him,—and
then when all’s said His loveliest and best
thoughts were also thought in the Vedas
by the Brahmins. It is wonderful beyond
comprehension to me how so many have
lived and died for such myths. The greatest
and divinest quality of God seems to me
to be His inexorableness, and even that failed
Him more than once at a pinch.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“It is a sense wanting in me,” she often told
Mr. Fellowes; “the sense of religion, as in
Dacre the sense of poetry, you can’t supply
it, no one can. I lose an infinite deal, I
know, your face literally shining over these
things tells me so, plainer than a thousand
words. I would give anything to experience
such rapture, which is itself divine,
but I couldn’t to save my life—it’s
curious!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dacre tells me,” she began suddenly
another day, “that he quite believes
in Christianity. Now, if his shallow feeble
acceptance of the thing—and he says
it is just like all the other fellows’ beliefs,—is
accepted, average Christianity must be
poor stuff. I will wait until I get a better
hold on it than that, before I say anything
definite about believing or disbelieving.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>I say merely, the scheme does not appeal
to me, the fault is in myself no doubt,
your judgment is sound in all other things,
I quite believe it is just as sound in
this.”</p>

<p class='c000'>On her seventeenth birthday, Mr. and
Mrs. Fellowes gave her an edition of
Browning.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The parts she understands will be a
revelation to her,” Mr. Fellowes said, “and
those she doesn’t will serve as a brain
tonic, for she will be sure to thresh them
out with blood-curdling thoroughness.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They were all this and more, as Mr.
Fellowes felt to his cost when a few
days later she brought him <cite>Caliban on
Cetebos</cite>.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now here,” she said, “is my exact
impression of the Christian God. I wonder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>if I shall ever change it, and by what
process? I must be in a horribly unfinished
initial state if I can think side
by side with a brutal creature like
that. It’s queer,—I am not altogether
like him in other respects,” she added
with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fellowes answered her, as he
always did, with perfect good humour and
sound good sense.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was hard, uphill, melancholy work
for him, but he did it like a man, and as
well as he knew how—he tried to hope,
and left the rest with God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes did her little part as soon
as the solemnities were at an end. She
seized on the girl and petted and made
much of her, and opened out her mother’s
heart to her.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“She must learn what love is, then
perhaps she will stop prying about after
justice and other matters. Besides, it is
absolutely necessary she should before she
has children of her own. She must be
bathed in it, so that she actually has to
absorb it like children do nourishment in
their bath of veal broth. I shall keep
driving it into her at every possible opportunity.
It would be an awful satisfaction
if just once in a while she would let one
get a real good glimpse into her, to see how
it works. I hate doing things in the dark!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But you do get a sight of the result
sometimes. I remember myself having
had several. I believe the girl has an
immense power of affection.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mercy on us! As if I did not know
that! When it does break out an earthquake
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>is a fool to it, but then the eruptions
are always so sudden and the calming
down so preternaturally swift that when
they happen one is far too overwhelmed
to have any time or faculty left for observation,
and one never dares to go back
on those outbursts, as you very well know.
Oh, my Gwen, my poor, poor little Gwen,
God will have to help your husband very
considerably!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And so Gwen grew up and her story
began.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>The</span> very air of Gwen’s two rooms, the
bedroom and the dressing-room off it,
shimmered with excitement. It glowed in
the soft light of the innumerable wax
candles with which Mary had studded the
tables, it hung in the rose-pink curtains,
it shone in the leaping blue flame of the
fire, it was everywhere and most inconveniently
so in the fingers of the new
lady’s maid, a creature of sentiment, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>was putting the finishing touches to her
young mistress’s bodice, while Mary was
trotting round restlessly, disturbed in every
individual hair of her head, casting rapt
glances at Gwen and furtive ones at the
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the sound of a footstep on the stairs
she gave a sudden start and her face
lighted, but it shaded as suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Only Mrs. Fellowes!” she murmured,
and she showed her in with some grimness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes stopped on the threshold
and took in Gwen leisurely with a half-choked
gasp of wonder, then she went
over and kissed her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen, love, you <em>are</em> beautiful, I never
knew it before!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen looked up at her then turned to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the glass and laughed. “I am,” she said,
“I am beautiful and <em>I</em> never knew it
before!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she stood up and shook down
the soft gleaming folds of her tulle-shrouded
silk and straightened herself.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was her first long dress, and added
two inches to her height.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look, I am changed, I am a new
creature, I am afraid of nothing! I feel
like a knight-errant setting forth on his
quest, his was glory, mine—” she paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What’s yours?” said Mrs. Fellowes
smiling on her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mine? Mine’s glory too.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She paused again, and a sudden trouble
leaped into her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But it’s due to me, see. Why not?”
And her great eyes flashed triumphantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>into the glass. “‘<em>I will attain</em>’ like Paracelsus.”</p>

<p class='c000'>She laughed again but her mirth had
a jar in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He went the wrong way about it,”
remarked Mrs. Fellowes placidly, “take
care you don’t do the same!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was a fraud to begin with, I’m
not, neither in brain nor body.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Fellowes looked at her critically,
“the outside of you is flawless enough, and,
goodness knows! you are all there as far
as brain goes. But I’m not so sure as to
the inside of you; there, an inch or so
to the left of that diamond star, I believe
you are perfectly empty!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh! That’s empty of course, except
for the bits of you and the rector it holds,
there’s been nothing to fill it.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“A thing must have a capacity for
holding before it can hold, my good child,
and original capacity dwindles from disuse,
as your father’s daughter must know.
Atrophy is the word in your jargon,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, all glory doesn’t come through
that mawkish muscle! I have lived for
nineteen years without anything to try the
holding capacity of mine, and I can go on
for a while yet and get my glory through
other channels.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No, you can’t, a woman’s crown of
glory comes through her heart or it isn’t
worth the wearing, her heart leads her
reason, and is often the surer guide into
the bargain.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why do you speak like this,” said
the girl, flushing, and flashing out a white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>arm towards her, “on my coming-out
night? It isn’t fair of you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You brought it on yourself, my Gwen,
you’re setting out on a wrong tack. Let
yourself go, child, be natural and strive
after—nothing. All good will come to
you by Divine right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A sudden chill ran down Mrs. Fellowes’
back, and a horrid little song began to
croon in her ears, “Through much tribulation”
were the words of it, and it kept
on by fits all that evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Turn round again and let me look at
you, dear. Ah, I feel as if it were the
coming-out night of my own child!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a quick short catch in her
voice. “Kiss me, Gwen, and, darling, don’t
think of victory, there’s blood in the
very thought! The head and front of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>woman’s life is love, God’s, and mother’s,
and man’s!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You’ve forgotten your audience,” said
Gwen sarcastically, “I know nothing of
the two first, the third will come, I
suppose, in time—by all accounts, it
comes always to the beautiful—but I shall
not know what on earth to do with it
when it arrives, and oh! I don’t want it!
I want to ‘live at full pitch’, I couldn’t
manage that with my feet clogged with
honey!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You want to be loved, my dear, to be
loved, loved, loved, and when you are,
you’ll find out what an arrant little goose
you are making of yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl turned suddenly upon her and
gave her one of her most volcanic hugs.
When Mrs. Fellowes got out of it, panting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>she set to putting Gwen’s dress in
order with sundry soft touches to neck
and arms.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do love nice soft girlish flesh,” she
said, with a little laugh. “Oh, how I do
wish to goodness that John wasn’t a
parson this night of all others! I want
dreadfully to see you there, but he can’t
come, it’s impossible, you know Sam Tidd
is dying and even for you I couldn’t go
without him!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mrs. Fellowes!” she cried sweeping
round, “are you not coming? This is, oh,
this is awful! I never looked at your
dress, I was so taken up with my own.
Oh, to go alone with Lady Mary, and to
my first ball!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Her face was furious, and Mrs. Fellowes
could have cried. “I did not tell you at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>first, I was so astonished at your brilliant
completeness, I <em>am</em> sorry.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Gwen stamped.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is atrocious, abominable! To go
alone with no one in the room to care
a rap how I look! You can’t help it, I
know, but oh, you must see the beastliness
of the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The carriage is coming, darling, come
down to your mother.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I? Certainly not! Mary and Simpson!”
she called.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There, isn’t it lovely?” said Gwen as
Simpson wrapped her in her cloak, “I do
love the sheeny changes in white plush!
Mrs. Fellowes, you will come down with
me, won’t you? I hardly know Lady
Mary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>When they came to the foot of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>stairs Mary came forward and said in a
quick frightened tone,</p>

<p class='c000'>“Miss Gwen, God bless you, dear!
They will be proud of you! The room
is well lighted, shall I open the door, Miss?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Did they ask for me?” demanded Gwen.
She had let her cloak drop and was turning
slowly round, that the old woman might
have a good view of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ask, Miss!”—She broke off.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I know they did not, and they don’t
want me either, and Mrs. Fellowes isn’t
coming—did you know that? I am glad
you like me, Mary!”</p>

<p class='c000'>She stooped suddenly seeing a tear on
Mary’s cheek, and kissed it into a wet
smudge on the bed of wrinkles, then she
turned and kissed Mrs. Fellowes lightly,
and walked down the great hall like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>young queen setting out on a triumphal
progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Gwen dropped her cloak and
displayed herself for Mary’s admiration,
she had two spectators she certainly never
bargained for.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wave of the universal excitement
had somehow reached Mr. and Mrs. Waring
in their learned retirement, probably carried
there by Mary’s frequent appearances for
trivial causes,—she dared not make any
definite suggestion, for fear of Gwen’s most
inexorable wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My love,” said Mr. Waring at last,
“something unusual seems to be the
matter!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mrs. Waring’s brows knitted as usual,
then gradually cleared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, I really believe this is the occasion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>of Gwen’s first ball. I remember now Lady
Mary mentioning something about it, and—ah,
yes, don’t you remember you gave
Mrs. Fellowes a cheque for some dresses
and other things to do with balls? Ah,
nine o’clock, is it really? And I fancy I
hear a carriage—didn’t Lady Mary say she
would come for her? I think, dear,” she
said, “I think, dear, I should like to see
Gwen.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And I too,” said Mr. Waring, standing
up with quiet eagerness, “shall we go to
her room? I suppose we might do so,”
he added, half fearfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>It certainly did seem rather a liberty
on their part.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh yes, I think that perhaps she might
like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So they opened the door and were just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>about to set forth when the sight of her
in shimmering soft waves of silk and tulle,
her round column of a neck poised like
that of an empress, and her arms thrown
out gracefully that Mary might see the
whole of her, arrested the two and held
them in a silent spell, standing hand in
hand on the threshold. Then, hand in
hand still, they went back into the
library as if in a dream, and over to the
deep embrasured window that opened on
the carriage drive, and listened to the
very last sound of Lady Mary’s wheels.
When they came back to the fire there
was a tear in Mrs. Waring’s eye, and
her husband felt horrid—just as if he had
lost a good thought.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>If</span> ever a girl’s coming-out was a triumphal
progress, Gwen’s was. There was just
the same suggestion of stifled groans,
and hidden wounds, and silent blood
streams in it, as there is in the processions
of all conquerors, and just the same
cool indifference to this part of the show
distinguished the girl’s face and added curiously
to its charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she swept calmly on her way her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>victims fell to right and to left of her
without a groan or a murmur, noisy
appeal seemed quite out of the question
in the presence of this magnificent inscrutable
creature.</p>

<p class='c000'>In her grand scornful way she revelled
in the glory of her march, and wore her
laurels as if she had been used to them
since her long-clothes’ days—this sort of
thing just suited her, it was so thoroughly
just, so fair, her mere due, and no more,
and she felt neither elation nor any special
gratitude in accepting it all.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a whole year—first in the country,
then in London—this went on, and Gwen
never felt so unconsciously Christian-like
in her life; she had no cause to rail
against anything; she had no time to feel
empty about the heart. Besides, her heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>was filled in a way with the steam from
the victims sacrificed in her honour, and
the intangibility of the stuffing didn’t
trouble her, it was warm and smelt like
spikenard.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for the feelings of the victims, these
did not enter into her calculations, the
whole show was so absolutely impersonal
to her. For any pangs she might feel
for the aloofness of the two she called
father and mother, she had decided some
time ago to smother these and to cast
them out, harbouring and encouraging
them never having altered or influenced
the state of affairs by one finger’s
breadth.</p>

<p class='c000'>She saw little of Mr. and Mrs. Fellowes
in these days. The Scripture lessons had
come to an end and she had turned the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>whole subject into her mind’s rubbish
hole; what she had learned was sufficiently
interesting at the time, but it had never
come any farther than to the outer edge
of her life, even when it was warmed
and lighted by Mr. Fellowes’ love for his
subject and when the hours spent at the
Rectory were the only bright flecks in
the week’s dinginess.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now all these surroundings were withdrawn,
the slight mist of glamour that
used to hang round the subject had floated
off, and Gwen was quite ready to shoot
her stored-up accumulation of facts and
deductions anywhere, to make room for
more serviceable stuff. Only, what we
have learned, good or bad, we must keep
somewhere, God help us!</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a clever girl, however, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>well-bred, and had read a good deal one
way and the other, so she had the sense
to hold her tongue and to keep her
embryo opinions to herself. This made
her equally magnanimous as regarded the
opinions of her neighbours.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gwen’s attitude of mind makes me
quite sick,” said Mrs. Fellowes one day,
“that is, when she shows a glimpse of
it, which isn’t often nowadays. She hasn’t
had a volcanic outbreak for a century,
they are ruinous to one’s clothes, but I’d
bear the spoiling of my new front for
one this minute.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Fellowes laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a twist in her somehow
and we have come to a nasty obstruction.
When she is properly straightened
she’ll be a fine creature, but the untwisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>will be too gradual for you, my poor
Ruth, you’ll be worn out before it’s
finished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“One would think she was a boa constrictor,
I believe she has a touch of its
nature too; she crushes hearts enough
anyway, and with just as little compunction.
I am sorry for young Patrick
Hamilton, I love that boy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which is no reason at all why Gwen
should. The girl doesn’t flirt, and he sought
his crushing with open eyes. I believe
it’s the girl’s brains as much as her
beauty that dominates and reduces men’s
hearts.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very likely—the bigger fool a man is,
the more he is vanquished by brain,
especially if it keeps itself in the background
and doesn’t frighten him. He likes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the agreeable sensation of importance the
possible possession of such a power gives
him, and in his state of nervous tension,
the creature is apt to get mixed and to
imagine that the power he worships
radiates somehow from him to his idol
instead of contrariwise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A very comprehensive summary of
our modes of thought, my dear, racy but
untrustworthy. I don’t, however, imagine
that in Gwen’s case any man is quite ass
enough to imagine himself the source of
her intellectual strength.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, perhaps not, Gwen’s getting beyond
me. If she goes on like this, between
brains and beauty, she’ll be no better
than a charnel house for crushed hearts.
Pah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For the shadow of the things, not the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>substance—do you imagine the victims
haven’t as firm a hold on their organs
as ever they had? It’s only an idea they
lose half the times.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, they make as much moan over
it as if it were a very tangible flesh-and-blood
article all bristling with nerves. I
hate to look at Patrick’s face, I wish he
would go and shoot buffaloes, or take a
tonic, or do anything but drink tea in that
chair and draw sympathy out of me with
those soft cowey eyes of his! He had only
just left when you came.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should be glad for your digestion’s
sake if he would recover himself, you’ve
swallowed three cups of tea in ten minutes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, to wash out the memory of that
boy!”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>“Rather a roundabout way to go to
work; if you don’t look out Pat’s heart
will be sound long before your digestive
organs are.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind, they haven’t a tinge of
Americanism about them, they haven’t
so much as caught the accent. But how
can you keep on being so hopeful of
Gwen? I am downright miserable about
her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have the greatest trust in the
girl, my feeling about her is like faith,
it is inexplicable, but it’s so natural, so
instinctive and ingrained one feels its
truth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose in the end she will marry,”
said Mrs. Fellowes, “it’s the natural end
or beginning of her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then—well, it’s not a very original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>observation to make, but it’s the only
one that comes to my mind—God help
her!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“<em>God help him more!</em> Poor wretch,
he’ll want it all!”</p>

  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Humphrey</span> Strange gave a sort of snort,
made for the window, and threw it open.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Gru! This room is beastly, I’ll swear
that window hasn’t been open for a month,
the whole place is fusty with mildew.
The beggar is drunk or the wire was delayed—I’ll
have a fire anyway.”</p>

<p class='c000'>By the way he went about making it,
it was easy to see the man knew his
work. First he shoved his stick up the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>chimney to see if that was free, then he
looked round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Plenty of kindling!” he muttered, pouncing
on a band-box in the corner with a
battered old hat in it. “Tolly’s, I’ll be
bound, reeking with grease,—a direct
interposition of Providence, this!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He crushed it up, crammed it into the
grate, and arranged broken pieces of band-box
above it with mathematical precision,
then he rummaged a broken chair out of
an inner room, smashed the rotten legs
across his knees, and added them to the
heap, which at the first touch of the match
shot into flame.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It will clean the brutal air,” he
remarked, “and it is quite cold enough
for a fire. I wish I had stayed where
I was till June. Tolly’s bout might have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>been over by that time. Not so much
as the smell of an oil rag here,” he
continued reflecting, “I must go out and
forage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Putting another chunk of chair on the
fire and forcing a side window open
with an ease that spoke well for his condition,
he went out and returned shortly
with a big knobbly parcel in one hand,
and a smooth brown-paper one in the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the first he produced a huge
wedge of steak, some cut slices of ham, and
a loaf of bread, the brown held a bottle of
beer.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the fire had burnt down to a
hot bed of cinders, Strange put the tongs
across it, the poker and a piece of thick
wire he had poked out of a cupboard
across these, then balanced the steak on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>the top of this gridiron, and watched
it fizzling and sputtering with a gratified air
of expectancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I left a gridiron, a saucepan, and a
kettle in the bottom of that cupboard,”
he mused, keeping a keen eye on the
grill, “all in decent condition. Tolly
again! I’ll put the fear of God in the
fellow’s heart before to-morrow’s out, ‘That
must be to-morrow, not to-night.’ A sell
for me, my boy, if not for you, I feel just
up to it now, by to-morrow the desire
may have lost its savour. I must find
something to put this steak on and to
hold the beer. Not a sign of my pewter!
Phew, one cracked glass! Lord! there
were dozens! and one hot-water plate
with half the delft off it, I could swear
I left that shelf full of crockery! and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>after this a Christian man is expected to
do no murder!”</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had got half through the slab
of steak a strong thirst came on Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is a cork-screw in one of my
inner pockets,” he reflected, looking lazily
round, “never mind, this is shorter!”</p>

<p class='c000'>He stretched out his arm for the poker,
and with it, knocked the top of the bottle
clean off and drank his beer with wholesome
satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had eaten and drunk
enough, he pushed back his plate and
glass, and took a bundle of quills and
some MS. paper out of a small cabinet.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Seemingly Tolly has found no use
for these,” he thought, as he sharpened a
quill.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then produced a bundle of smudgy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>notes from an inner pocket and laid them
by the paper.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll have a thorough good smoke,” he
said, stretching his legs “and then I’ll be
game for six hours’ work. I swear,” he
continued, rubbing his hideous, inch-long,
bristly, reddish beard, “I’ll not touch an
individual bristle of this mat till Lynton
has got his first consignment of ‘copy’, then
I shall clean up and resume civilization.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange was a good many things but
he was above all others a traveller, he
had neither nerves nor stomach, which is
proof sufficient that he had been preordained
to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</span></i>, and he had discovered
his election very early in life.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the opening of one of his Eton
vacations, when to look at he was a mere
chit of a child with a pair of gray eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>that were staggering from the sheer artlessness
of them, he had dodged the parental
eye at Waterloo, and instead of going
down into Plowshire, he had taken ship
at Rotherhithe, and had reached Amsterdam
by the skin of his teeth, the tub
being untrustworthy and nearly foundering
in mid-channel.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he came back, more artless than
ever to look at, he knew as much of
the life of the Hollanders of all classes
and of every side of the life, moreover,
as if he had dwelt among them for a
round five years.</p>

<p class='c000'>On his return to school he proceeded to
record his experiences in the school organ,
and on their appearance in that chaste
journal, he was had up before his house
master.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Where did you hear all this, Strange?”
demanded the scandalized gentleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I saw it, sir, and it’s quite true,” was
the artless reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The deuce it is!” muttered Dr. Bromby.
“That hardly betters matters. I have
ordered every copy of this paper to be
burnt, Strange,” said the doctor severely,
“and in future, I wish to look through
your manuscript myself before it goes to
the press. Unalloyed truth is sometimes
out of place. Stick to your classics, Strange,
you will write well some day, that is, if
you become a little surer in your Latin,
otherwise your English will always be
slovenly. If I were you I should reserve
some of my experiences, if you are in the
habit of entertaining your fags with them
in off-times,” concluded the doctor.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“Yes, sir,” said Humphrey, and departed
cheerily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange had just now come back unexpectedly
from a long tour in Algeria.
According to his own way of thinking
he had had a glorious time if ever man
had. He had lived in the tents of the
Arabs, in the camps of the coast Zouaves,
and in the hills and the deserts with the
Bedouins, like David.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had known</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Of the plunge in a pool’s living water, the hunt of the bear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the sultriness showing the lion is couched in his lair.</div>
      <div class='line'>And the meal, the rich dates yellowed over with gold-dust divine,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the locust flesh steeped in the pitcher, the full draught of wine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>He had braved heat, cold, hunger, thirst,
filth and squalor, fleas and worse than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>fleas, snakes and beasts of prey, but he
had learned a new variety of man and of
the conditions that mould men’s lives.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had lived the life himself and could
think as such men think, feel as they
feel, speak and act as they do. He had
gained a new power and felt a new
growth of manhood quickening in his veins,
and now he was recording what he knew.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many travellers only <em>see</em> he <em>knew</em>. He
had touched the core of the heart of
things, and every word he wrote carried
conviction to those who read and marvelled
at the wonderful knack the fellow had of
telling primitive truths cleanly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange kept his word and worked
without break for six hours on end, then
he tumbled off his seat with sudden sleep,
having just sense enough to first roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>himself in his Ulster. When Tolly arrived
next morning at eleven o’clock, the delayed
wire in his hand and his hair erect
with terror, he found his master snoring
in a strong breeze, with the full sun on
him, and at least a pound of dried grease
all over the fender. Tolly groaned.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Tolly</span> proceeded in a vague sort of
scurry to clear up. But in general confusion
of conscience and in his gin-begotten
shakiness, he presently dropped the poker
with a clatter, and Strange awoke and sat
bolt upright in his Ulster.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Tolly, how do you feel?” he
demanded blandly, regarding the forlorn,
dirty figure with a persistent and contemplative
stare that caused it to wriggle
and writhe like a worm.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Tolly was a very long, thin, crooked
person, whether young or old it was
impossible to decide, unless you happened
to have seen his baptismal register.</p>

<p class='c000'>His mother herself was rather at sea on
the question. “He has always looked like
that from a baby,” she remarked to the
school inspector, when he called one day to
round up the urchin, who from his lanky
length certainly looked quite meet for
Primers. “I don’t believe myself he’s that
old but he may be, there ain’t no tellin’,
he’s that queer one can’t never say nothin’
certain regardin’ him.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tolly’s freckles were his great point,
they were so many, so parti-coloured
and so varied in form; they congregated
most on his long thin nose, and tumbled
over one another in a way that gave the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>appendage a scaly look like the tail of a
fish. Tolly’s teeth suffered from early
decay; he may have had a few back-grinders
but all he could boast of in
front was one abnormally long fang at
the right side, that wobbled frightfully at
every word, and when he was nervous
from gin wobbled even when he was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I remember aright,” continued
Strange, “you took the pledge the night
before I left, you cried too—let alone
roared—with remorse.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, sir, I don’t deny nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’d like to catch you at it! Well,
how long did you keep the pledge?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe it were a matter of three
weeks, sir, then I cotched cold.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, indeed! And the gin cotched you?
Now, clear up that place. I shall cook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>breakfast myself. When you have put
things ship-shape from my point of view,
not yours, recollect, I shall give you sixpence,
then you can go to the baths round
the corner and scrub yourself from head
to foot. Your things—except the hat, I
burnt that, you appear to have stored
dripping in it—are in the box I gave you,
put them on and then wait here for me.
That gridiron, those tumblers, those cups
and other things you have smashed or
pawned, you will buy out of your next
three weeks’ wages—Farris’s gin-hole has
all your savings, no doubt. And to-night I
shall give you a dose of castor oil mixed
with senna.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Lord help me!” groaned Tolly,
and he shuffled nearer to his master, with
his slits of lips drawn tight across his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>fang—he had experienced Strange’s treatment
before this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now stop groaning, and do your work,
neither I nor the Lord would touch you
with a pair of tongs in your present
beastly condition! You have earned your
punishment and of course you shall get
it. If you lived decently you would have
a first-rate place and you know it, and,
look here, I have come to the end of my
patience, if I find you in this state again,
I shall sack you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tolly gave an anguished squeal.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I’ll try, sir, I does try, I swear
to God I does. I tries, I does, till I sweats
like a bullock and doesn’t know if I’m
on my head or my heels, but summow
it ain’t no go. Don’t sack me, for the
love of God, don’t, sir.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“Finish your sweeping, and go over that
place under the table again. I shall see
how you get on after the bath and the
castor oil.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor beggar!” said Strange to himself,
as he ate his ham and drank his
well-sweetened tea. “Poor beggar! I
wonder if I shall ever make anything out
of him! Only that the creature is so
weakly—look at the miserable hold of his
claws on that dustpan!—I should take
him about with me, the Arabs would
teach him sobriety anyway and he might
pose as an apostle of Christianity among
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this thought Strange chuckled aloud,
and helped himself to another slice of
ham.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tolly’s face brightened as he heard the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>sound, he turned furtively to watch his
earthly Providence, and went on with his
dusting with redoubled fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” said Strange, when he had
finished, “carry all these things into the
next room and have a good feed. When
did you happen to have your last meal?”</p>

<p class='c000'>On the point of truth Strange was
inexorable; the fellow dared not lie, but he
had a sort of bastard pride about him and
felt the question keenly. Turning a sickly
puce, he stammered,</p>

<p class='c000'>“I haven’t had nothing yesterday, sir,
summow I didn’t feel like it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No? Well, if I were you I’d cultivate
the feeling now. Send in the barber
on your way to the bath, and hand down
that ink bottle from the shelf before you
go. Pah! you can’t even fill an ink bottle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>your hand shakes so! Upon my word,
if I have to sack you I don’t know what
you’ll do, you aren’t worth fourpence a
week in this condition.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Tolly gave a dumb shudder and his
fang kept time to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Five years before, Strange had picked
him up out of a sewer, where he went to
learn the trade of ratting. Strange liked to
learn the ins and outs of anything that
had any suggestion of human interest
in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had brought the half-dead, mouldy
creature to his rooms, and after saving
his life, it struck him to keep it, and see
what could be done with it. This was
the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>As long as Strange was at home Tolly
kept straight, but directly he was out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>reach, the miserable absorbing craving
took hold of the wretch, and pinched,
and pulled, and nipped, as with raging
hot irons, at the very soul of him, till
at last he swallowed his humanity at a
gulp, gave way to the beast, and fled
to the gin-shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>For three weeks he had endured the
torture this last time, Strange thought
with grim pity, as he watched him,
through the heavy Eastern curtains, devouring
his food to the dropping of tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Poor beggar! I shall never be able
to get rid of him as long as life holds
whatever morsel of soul he may have in him.
Meanwhile, I cannot stand that solitary
fang; when he has got over his brew I
shall get him a set of teeth.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He lay back and laughed. “They’ll be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the ruin of his immortal soul, those teeth;
fancy the grin of the fellow when his
lips have a resisting surface to stretch
across! Brown will charge frightfully for
filling such a cavern.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed again and turned to his
work, and in two hours he had the first
batch of “copy” ready for the printer.
Then he yawned and stretched, and
apologized to the barber, whom he had
kept waiting an hour and ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he was shaved, he dressed, and
set forth to resume civilization.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
  <h2 class='c007'>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>When</span> he got outside his rooms, which
were in a turning off Piccadilly, Strange
looked up and down the street and at
his watch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall not bother with luncheon, that
ham will last till eight,” he said, “I shall
go to the Club and I suppose I must see
Aunt Moll. I’ll go there to tea, she’ll be
up probably, and perhaps awake by that
time.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>He struck out for his Club and made
a rapid tour of the premises but he found
there was no good to be got there, the
billiard-rooms were empty and the reading-rooms
were given over to half a dozen
old fellows suffering from gout and senile
decay.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s too early and too late for anything,”
he muttered, as he lighted a fresh cigar
on the steps, “it will be a full week,
besides, before I get into the swing again.
I shall try Brydon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>With that he swung off down the street,
past some big thoroughfares, then he cut
across a mesh of alleys and courts, out
into some dingy squares, landing at last
in Bloomsbury Square. He walked round
till he got to a tall narrow house in a
corner, where he pulled up, pushed open
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the door, which was ajar, and went upstairs
to the fifth story where he found
a door with “Mr. Brydon” painted on it
in big letters. He opened it, and walked in.</p>

<p class='c000'>A big fair boy with a cigarette in his
mouth was sitting before an easel,
touching up a background; he spoke in a
soft tired voice without turning an inch
of himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Excuse me, Carry, I can’t possibly stand
up, I am wrestling with a curtain. Kindly
sit down and begin your apologies. Was
Ma’s ‘neuralgy’ bad, or the baby? Was it
‘it’? I am not quite certain as to the sex
of the last.—By the way, don’t they come
with undue speed, those babies, or do
you spread all the diseases out on one?—Or
did Pa go for you and render your nose
unfit for immortality? Two hours behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>time to-day, that’s nothing to you in the
day’s work, no doubt, but I may remark
that it’s slightly inconvenient to me, as
I prefer daylight to dark to catch the
super-excellent tones of your skin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should have thought on the whole
that the glow——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Strange!” he cried with a soft slow
gurgle of intense delight, and lifting
himself clumsily up from his seat, he
caught Strange’s hand in a close clasp
and pushed him back into an old frilled
arm-chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought you were in Algeria. It
was a dangerous experiment, old fellow;
the betting was ten to one that I was
painting off a model, and I am continually
overlooking that lock. You’re only just
back, I see. What a glorious dusty smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>red you’ve got on your cheeks! For goodness
sake, let me have it before gas and
sich play the deuce with it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take it, my child, take it. What a
pity you didn’t have the beard too! that
was a far more glorious red, and a sight
dustier, but I parted with it this morning.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, I’ve seen your bristles
once; I never wish to behold them again.
Now smoke, and I’ll just have a shy at
catching that tint, it’s precisely what I
want for this beggar’s cheek. My model
had it to perfection, but they clapped him
into quad for prigging saveloys, and when
he comes out he will be useless, the colour
of bad paste.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your room’s hardly serious enough;
it’s pretty, in a doll’s-house style.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Serious! I can’t afford that. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>can’t extract seriousness from rags, but
the colours are good and the cost small.
Look at the drapery hiding the crack
in the wall in that corner, fourpence-halfpenny
the yard and a reduction by
the piece!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you probably went dinnerless
for that!” thought Strange, watching
the tall heavy-looking fellow, with his
straight, limp brown hair hanging over
his forehead in a way that gave him a
queer, foolish look, an effect that his big
alive eyes were constantly contradicting.</p>

<p class='c000'>The soft, sleepy tones of his voice which,
only that they happened to be peculiarly
clear, would never have been heard at
all, added rather to this effect. Strange,
however, was quite aware that the eyes
of the fellow spoke the truth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>that the hair and the soft speech lied.</p>

<p class='c000'>His father had been curate in the parish
where Strange’s father was the Squire, and
even then the big boy had been good to the
little one, and the unequal friendship was
still kept up between the two. It was a
pleasant little corner in the life of the
older man, it was the best part of life
to the boy, and no one had a notion of
the intense love and gratitude he bore to
the big notable man who took the trouble
to know him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange had stood by him in the bad
crisis of his life, when things had come
to a head and his father, the curate, had
put down his foot and damned art permanently,
and the boy, for his part, had
comprehensively damned the church, and
had then stepped out of the parental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>porch with a five-pound note in his pocket,
and in his eyes the yearning greed for
colour.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How are you getting on?” said Strange.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, I live, and I hardly owe a thing,
which is a consolation, in case I happened
to die off in a hurry, and had to be beholden
to the governor to fork up. I have no
feelings at all about the funeral expenses
or the shroud, I shall make no provision
for these, they seem in his line, somehow.
But it would cut the old man up frightfully
if he had to pay the models or the
beer, or anything smacking of the devil,
you know—Would you mind turning your
face an inch to the right?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What are you at? Haven’t you got
the brick-dust yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, in a way, but I want to sketch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>you,” said Brydon, measuring him with
his pencil, “I won’t be long; you look
so cool, and big, and ‘kinder’ dogged,
you’ve given me a notion. You’ve grown
frightfully since you went away, especially
about the eyes, they’ve got so beastly
deep and intricate, why don’t you have
eyes like decent God-fearing mortals?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ask my parents; if they refuse you
the information, I can only refer you to
my godfather and godmother—By the way,
what’s wrong with you, Charlie?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Me!—Nothing!—I had another bout
of rheumatic fever a month ago, and
I have felt a trifle stodgy since at
times, especially after a grind up these
stairs.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Heart!” thought Strange. “Poor beggar!
it’ll be hard on him if he’s carried off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>before he learns to draw. Will you dine
with me to-day?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon’s face lit, he had ecstatic memories
of dinners with Strange, and as a
matter of fact his dinners for two days
past, had consisted of bread—and mustard
to give it a relish.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you, old man, I can’t—I can’t
go anywhere till Friday.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, in Heaven’s name?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have some black and white to do,”
he said mixing some paint hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange took a glance at his back view
and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The beggar’s sure to let it out, he
always does,” he reflected.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a few minutes’ silent painting
Brydon turned round.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I generally tell you most things,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>said, “if you wait long enough, and you
know by this time what an abject ass
I am, so you may as well hear the
climax.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I was down sketching in Surrey last
month. I went after the fever—I didn’t
feel as if I could stand the stairs just
then—and I found a girl in a cottage there
who was willing to sit for me whenever
I wanted her. She was—divine! Look!”
he got up slowly and took a little canvas
from behind the door. “Look! Did Greuse
ever have such a head to paint from? I
fell in love with her. Of course, it was
that colour that did it; that, and her poses,
and all her little ways and movements,
and her soft little voice—oh—oh—you
know the sort of fool I am! I lodged at
her mother’s house, and the pair nursed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>me as if I were a sick cat—well—Look!—I
had to leave that place at a moment’s
notice or I don’t know what might have
happened—you know. I paid up and
cleared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Would you believe it, I hadn’t been
home a week, when who should appear
one night past ten o’clock but that girl?
Upon my word, I broke out in a cold
sweat all over. I’m as weak as water,
and—she was divine. I tell you—I had
an awful job altogether. I quieted her
down first, then I had to bathe her feet,
such pretty pink little ones, but all torn
and bruised. If you believe me, she had
walked from ten miles this side of Godalming.
I got her some food and gave her up my
bed, and somehow or other I got her back
next day; she’d have stayed on any terms,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>poor little soul! Girls are queer fish,”
he said modestly, “one never can tell
what’ll fetch them. It was all pretty hot
on the mother, however, so I gave her
the few shillings I had, and then she wrote
to say that the girl got fever from the
walk, so of course I’ve had to help them,
and I regret to say my boots have gone
for a change to mine uncle’s. I shall be
paid on Friday, and then I’ll bloom back
into my pristine glory and accept invitations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder,” he went on reflectively, “if
there’s any way of keeping a fellow from
making a fool of himself. If you have
happened to hear of any in your travels,
an anti-love philtre now, for Heaven’s
sake divulge it, it ruins one’s work getting
in love in a promiscuous way, it’s a brutal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>nuisance too, and devilish expensive. I
know I always have to pay compound
interest for my pleasures in this line, and
they’re absolutely mawkish too, in their innocence,”
he added, with a little injured sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange watched the boy curiously,
wondering what possible motive, or train
of motives, combined to keep his life so
clean, with its every condition on the side
of uncleanness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He has neither convictions nor religion
to hold him, he is as passionate and sensual
a fellow as any going, he is steeped to
the lips in Zola and others of that ilk;
theoretically, innocence and he are as
far apart as the poles. He is a fool, no
doubt, but I wish to God the folly would
last.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Brydon guessed the elder man’s thoughts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>or perhaps his own were running on the
same lines, as he sketched in the strong
steady cool face with a breadth of technique
that was marvellous in a boy of his age
and opportunities.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wonder myself,” he said, “I don’t
make more of my pleasures. A fellow has
opportunities somehow,” he added with
pleasing diffidence, “no matter how poor
he is but I have a sort of notion I
might lose in Art what I should gain in
pleasure. It would be idiotic to run that
risk, wouldn’t it? I have a sort of theory,
it’s probably rot though it has a sound of
truth about it, that the cleaner one keeps
one’s body and soul, the clearer one’s
eyes keep and the better able to tackle
the truth in Nature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, a little embarrassed; any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>expression, even of the most primitive
morality, brings a blush of shame to the
cheek of youth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That sounds like a workable theory,”
assented Strange, “and upon my word, I
believe you will find it so. The opposite
is playing the deuce with the modern Italian
school, and it strikes one like a blow in
a lot of the work of the youngsters there.
I would thresh out that theory, if I were
you, nothing half and half will do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Brydon ruefully, “no, that
is where the grind comes in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange laughed, the fellow’s face and
accent fitted his speech so comically.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I suppose I must let him get over the
boot business himself, he’s so beastly cocky,
but I’m convinced he’s hungry. I wonder
how much the jade got out of him! Charlie,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>he then said aloud, “I must be off, I shall
expect you on Friday at my Club. If I
were you, old chap, I should stop that
young person’s supplies, the fever must
be off her by this time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a sort of awful conviction
that it’s going to be intermittent, and that
nothing but a change of address will have
any effect upon it—but, oh, old man, if
you could have seen that girl,” he concluded
regarding her head mournfully, with his own
on one side, and with an overwhelming
longing for the Egyptian flesh-pots surging
up within him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Strange slapped him on the shoulder,
“Just as well not, fevers come expensive,
whether they take you, or the victim to
your charms. Good-bye.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
